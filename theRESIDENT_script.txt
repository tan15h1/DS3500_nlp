COLD OPEN
EXT. KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
A monolithic high-rise hospital with many wings and floors.
The enormous complex stands on the shore of the Charles
River, pulsing with life and death, like a city unto itself.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
A sharp knife slices through flesh as DR. SOLOMON BELL
(60’s), gowned and gloved, operates on a patient. The mood is
laid back, the surgery routine. YO-YO MA plays in the
background.
Anesthesiologist, PETER CHU, looks over the shoulder of
CLAUDIA, the circulating nurse, who’s streaming a Red Sox
game on her phone.
CLAUDIA
Sox are down one. Bottom of the
fourth. Two on base.
PETER CHU
(to Bell)
Yank that sucker already so we can
catch the end of the game.
Bell pokes his gloved fingers around in the gut of the
patient.
BELL
Appendix hasn’t burst. Good news.
Then reaches for the appendix, a pencil-shaped organ buried
between loops of bowel. Fumbles it, mutters.
BELL (CONT’D)
Slippery little fellow.
A SCRUB NURSE holds out forceps for Bell, glances at a bulge
in the drapes below the abdomen. She lifts them.
SCRUB NURSE
Oh my God. Check out that giant
meat popsicle.
Everyone, even Bell, stops to look. The anesthesiologist
stands up to peer over the curtain. They react.
CLAUDIA
We gotta get a picture.
Claudia fiddles with her iPhone.
PETER CHU
You have to put something there for
scale. Like a Coke can.
BELL
This is totally inappropriate.
(beat)
You can’t use a coke can.
CLAUDIA
Then what?
As they search for the right object, the patient starts to
twitch. Nobody notices.
Bell passes a DEBAKEY. The scrub nurse positions the tool
next to the penis. Claudia frames the shot, snaps the photo
as Bell resumes the operation.
As he touches down with his scalpel, the patient JERKS.
BELL
Sweet Jesus, he’s awake.
The anesthesiologist jumps to resume his post. But the
patient’s eyes fly open and he JERKS again. Hard. Bell
instinctively yanks back his scalpel, still in the surgical
field.
Not a good move. A GEYSER OF BLOOD shoots up from inside the
patient’s abdomen.
SCRUB NURSE
Did you hit the aorta?
CLAUDIA
(in disbelief)
On an appendectomy?
BELL
He jerked and hit my hand!
PETER CHU
Losing blood fast. Hang two liters
of normal saline wide open, call
for FFP stat, Trendelenberg.
BELL
(focusing)
Aortic clamp. 5-0 vascular prolene.
Suction.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 2.
The scrub nurse passes him tools. The blood is still
fountaining, spilling over onto the table and floor.
Bell dives his hands into the pool, searching for the
bleeder.
BELL (CONT’D)
Come on, come on--
CLAUDIA
You have to clamp something! He’s
exsanguinated at least four liters
already--
Bell’s hands continue to poke around furiously, but the blood
keeps coming.
Claudia tries to move to a different position and slips in
the blood, nearly does a face plant.
CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
WHAT THE F-!
PETER CHU
We just lost a pulse!
The monitors begin to FLATLINE.
PETER CHU (CONT’D)
PEA arrest! Start compressions!
CLAUDIA
CPR isn’t going to put all that
blood back into his body.
Bell pushes forward, sweating, begins compressions.
BELL
Do not die on me.
Bell shoves a few times, his arms bloody up to his elbows.
The anesthesiologist intercedes.
PETER CHU
Bell. She’s right. No use.
Bell, breathing hard, backs off the patient. They all stand
there in utter silence. Except for Yo-Yo Ma, who continues,
cheery.
CLAUDIA
He is so dead.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 3.
Bell removes his mask. We get our first clear look at him.
He’s distinguished, dapper, with a fine head of grey hair.
Every inch the image of an ideal surgeon, apart from the fact
he’s covered in blood and just killed his patient.
Now everyone pulls off their sterile gowns and masks. Peter
Chu (30s) is Chinese, chubby and short. Claudia (40s) is
Latino, an experienced hand with no illusions. The scrub
nurse (20s) is young, terrified.
They are, in effect, at the scene of a murder and they know
it. Bell turns to the anesthesiologist.
BELL
I think we can all agree it was the
misdosed sevo that led to this
unfortunate situation.
PETER CHU
You’re kidding, right? You nicked
the aorta.
(to the others)
You’re both witnesses.
The nurses look anywhere but at the doctors. Bell moves in on
the Anesthesiologist. The cover story is forming in his head.
BELL
You never should have cleared him
for surgery, his INR was abnormal.
PETER CHU
(panicking)
Bullshit! It was upper range of
normal! That’s never going to fly.
BELL
I’m flashing back to the time you
tore through that old woman’s
oropharynx on a routine intubation.
Did that fly? I covered for you.
Peter backs off, silenced.
BELL (CONT’D)
(to nurses)
I’m chief of surgery. He’s a 2nd
year resident at the end of a 30
hour shift. What did you two see?
They stare at each other, unsure what to say.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 4.
PETER CHU
We’re all on the same team here,
right?
A beat. A change in the atmosphere. Everyone nods in
agreement.
SCRUB NURSE
(weak)
Maybe he had a heart attack?
Chu grabs the patient’s chart.
PETER CHU
Some family history of heart
disease.
BELL
Yes. His left main clogged. Sudden
cardiac event.
CLAUDIA
We tried CPR. It didn’t work.
BELL
(firm)
There was no way to prevent this.
Claudia pulls off her blood-stained gloves, takes out her
phone again.
BELL (CONT’D)
(cold)
Who the hell are you calling?
CLAUDIA
I’m erasing the dick photo, Doctor.
INT. DEVON’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
PAN OVER a stack of medical textbooks, framed diploma from
Harvard Medical School, pictures of an Indian family at
graduation, smiling, proud beyond words.
DEVON PRAVESH (26) is in bed, naked, next to PRIYA NAIR (25),
his beautiful fiance. Devon is on his phone looking at an
orientation schedule.
She stirs, snuggles closer to him.
PRIYA
What time is it?
Kings County 1/ll/2017 5.
DEVON
Early.
PRIYA
Did you sleep at all last night?
DEVON
20 milligrams of Ambien. 50 of
Benadryl. So, yeah.
She looks at his phone.
PRIYA
What’s that?
DEVON
My schedule for the day.
She takes his phone away. He grabs it back, gets out of bed.
PRIYA
It says you don’t have to be at the
hospital till 7:30.
DEVON
The subway could break down. I’d
rather be early.
INT. DEVON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING
Devon, in dark pants and a button down shirt, irons his tie.
Priya, in a beautiful Indian silk robe, appears in the
doorway. Everything about her says she has money. Everything
about Devon’s shitty apartment says he doesn’t. She watches
him, amused.
PRIYA
You’re ironing your tie.
He picks it up, wraps it around his neck. She moves closer,
starts to help but he pulls away. Expertly knots the tie.
He’s a perfectionist.
PRIYA (CONT’D)
You’ve always been the best at
everything you’ve done.
She moves closer, speaks softly.
PRIYA (CONT’D)
You’ve got this.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 6.
DEVON
I know.
He focuses on her, grateful for the support, kisses her. Then
he grabs his jacket, heads into the next room. She follows.
PRIYA
We have to do something tonight to
celebrate your first day as a
doctor.
INT. DEVON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As they enter...
DEVON
My first day as a doctor ends
tomorrow at noon. Then I’m going to
sleep.
She picks up his new white coat, still in plastic. Hands it
to him.
PRIYA
Dinner tomorrow at the Taj? We
could stay the night.
DEVON
Yeah, let’s do that. In four years.
Meantime, I’ll make 50 grand a year
in residency. With a 110 hour week -
- that’s 8.7 dollars an hour.
Starbucks pays better.
She shakes her head in wonder.
PRIYA
Why does anyone want to be a
doctor?
DEVON
It’s all I ever wanted.
EXT. KINGS COUNTY - PARKING LOT - MORNING
A parking lot labelled “DOCTORS ONLY.” A TESLA pulls in. We
move slowly with it down the row past BMWs, AUDIs, PORCHEs to
a spot marked “DR. CONRAD HAWKINS.”
The RANGE ROVER adjoining is over the line, taking too much
room.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 7.
The Tesla idles without a sound. The driver’s side door
opens. An empty beer can falls out. A CUSTOM PUMA SNEAKER
emerges. Then another. Door slams. A foot kicks the beer can
aside.
Move up expensive jeans to see CONRAD HAWKINS (32), 3rd year
resident. Unshaven, wears a trendy Japanese T-shirt,
untucked.
He’s handsome, eyes hidden behind expensive sunglasses.
Conrad sucks on his vaping pen and watches as the Tesla
expertly slides into the constricted spot, parking itself.
As he moves past the Range Rover, headed for the hospital, he
casually keys the offending SUV.
INT. NURSE’S STATION - DAY
NICOLETTE (31) aka NIC, a pretty, petite blonde, bends over
trying to open a file cabinet. Conrad appears behind her,
touches her ass.
CONRAD
Can I help?
She spins on him, shoves him away.
NIC
(hisses)
Don’t.
CONRAD
You liked it last night.
NIC
That was a mistake.
CONRAD
You say that every time.
He pulls the file cabinet open for her, oddly gallant.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Have a lovely day.
He smiles, charming, as he steals her coffee, walks off. Nic
turns to the CHARGE NURSE. Points to a dirt encrusted
HOMELESS MAN with an obvious herpes sore on his lip and pants
that are stiff from urine.
NIC
Make sure Dr. Hawkins gets that
patient.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 8.
INT. SUBWAY - SAME TIME
Dev is on the subway. He’s amped up, excited, takes a deep
breath. Big day. Checks the clock on his phone for the tenth
time. He hangs onto the strap, the white coat still in its
wrapper tucked under his arm.
He notices the MAN beside him has bronze-colored palms. He
can’t stop himself...
DEVON
I’m sorry to bother you, but how
long have your hands been that
color?
The man looks down at his palms, shrugs.
DEVON (CONT’D)
It could mean you have a condition -
- Hemochromatosis -- that causes an
excessive accumulation of iron in
the body. It’s serious.
MAN
I drink a lot of carrot juice.
DEVON
Oh. Then that’s probably all it is.
Never mind.
Devon looks away, slightly embarrassed.
MAN
Are you a doctor?
It feels strange to say it, but...
DEVON
I guess I am.
MAN
The work you do every day-- it’s
amazing. Truly noble. And thanks
for, you know--
He holds up his palms. Devon smiles, basking in the glow of
admiration. This already feels so great. The subway stops and
he moves to get off passing--
A string of ads for KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL with pictures of
Dr. Solomon Bell. The distinguished surgeon from the Cold
Open is the face of the hospital. He has a reassuring smile,
with just the right amount of paternal concern, as he cradles
a patient’s hand.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 9.
The ad says: “KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL - COMMITTED TO
EXCELLENCE.”
INT. KINGS COUNTY - WARD - MORNING
Conrad sprawls on a patient bed, on his phone. We can’t see
what he’s doing. TASSO (31), a bearded, neurotic, harried
fellow resident, approaches.
TASSO
Four heart failure disasters. Two
went straight to the unit. One is
cold and dry. Haven’t even started
my notes. Attending wants me to do
a presentation on NOACs--
CONRAD
Sounds terrible.
TASSO
And now I have an early admission.
Can you take it?
CONRAD
I’m slammed.
We see that he’s on TINDER. The app suddenly DINGS as he
matches with a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE (24). At the bottom of the
screen, it reads: “Location: Less than 100 feet from you.”
He looks up to see the same BEAUTIFUL BLONDE being rolled
into the unit on a gurney.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Is that the early admission?
TASSO
Yeah.
CONRAD
I’ll take it.
He gets up out of bed. Just as he does, the HOMELESS PATIENT
waddles up to them with his urine-soaked pants. The sore on
his lip now bleeding.
HOMELESS MAN
The nurse said you’re my doctor.
Conrad takes out a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL.
CONRAD
This is yours.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 10.
The man reaches for it. Conrad snatches it back.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
If you walk out that door right
now.
The homeless man takes the bill, quickly stuffs it into his
pocket. Shuffles out.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - LOBBY - DAY
DEVON ENTERS and is instantly awed at the soaring lobby.
A HARPIST plays celestial music as Devon glimpses the kind of
quick vignettes we’ve come to expect from network medical
shows -- a nurse cooing over a mom and her newborn baby,
helpful volunteers guiding anxious visitors, a handsome
doctor giving good news to a grateful patient.
He moves on filled with pride at the new life he’s beginning.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - MORNING
Devon emerges from an elevator examining his new hospital ID.
Below the photo, in huge letters, is the word “DOCTOR.”
He looks up, sees Bell, the surgeon from the cold open, who
is down the hall with a group of senior doctors. They exude
expertise and power. Bell is a standout among them, tall and
handsome, at ease.
CALEB JORDAN (27), African-American goofball and fellow first
year resident, arrives beside Dev.
DEVON
Isn’t that the guy from the subway
ads?
CALEB
Dr. Bell. Chief of surgery. I sat
in on one of his lectures in
medical school.
DEVON
The surgeon who operated on Reagan
after he was shot.
CALEB
Thirty-five years ago. The nurses
call him HODAD.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 11.
DEVON
HODAD? What does that mean?
CALEB
No idea.
Suddenly Caleb’s phone dings. He looks at it.
CALEB (CONT’D)
My supervising resident just texted
me.
CHYRON: “Can’t wait to meet you! :) ;)”
CALEB (CONT’D)
A smiley and winky face.
Devon’s phone dings next. He checks it.
CHYRON: “MEET ME IN PHYSICAL THERAPY. TRY NOT TO BE A DICK.”
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PHYSICAL THERAPY - MORNING
Devon approaches, smooths his coat again, sees his
supervising resident’s back ahead of him. He’s looking
through a window at women in spandex, bending and stretching
as they work with patients.
DEVON
Good morning, Sir. I’m Devon
Pravesh, your resident--
Conrad turns, looks at Devon. Ignores the hand he offers. No
smile.
CONRAD
Namaste. Take off that tie.
DEVON
But I thought--
CONRAD
Take. It. Off.
Devon takes a beat, stunned. Slowly removes the tie, folds it
carefully into his coat pocket.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Untuck your shirt. You’re not at
Harvard anymore.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 12.
Devon does it with growing unease. Conrad turns his attention
back to the physical therapists. One bends over to pick up a
foam roller. Squeezes it between her legs.
Devon pulls out a PATIENT ROSTER.
DEVON
Do we have a patient here?
CONRAD
What we have here are the hottest
women in the hospital. Number two
are nutritionists. Forget hitting
on nurses. They make a lot of money
and they hate doctors. PT and
nutrition always put out on the
long-shot one of us will marry
them. What are you into? White?
Black? Brown?
Devon refuses to answer, offended now. Conrad looks at him.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Men?
DEVON
I’m sorry. I don’t understand
what’s happening here.
Conrad abruptly walks out of the physical therapy room. Devon
follows.
CONRAD
You don’t understand? Were you
Affirmative Action at Harvard?
DEVON
I’m Indian. We actually get reverse
affirmative action. There are
quotas.
CONRAD
Got perfect grades. Top of your
class. Followed all the rules?
DEVON
(defensive)
Something like that.
CONRAD
And you think that puts you at an
advantage. It doesn’t. You just
have more to unlearn than the ones
who weren’t paying attention.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 13.
DEVON
I don’t think that’s true.
CONRAD
Everything I say is true. That’s
Rule #1.
Devon chuckles, cautiously, as if this is a joke.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Oh no, it’s not like that. We’re
not laughing together.
(beat)
You’ve memorized everything and
know nothing. Well, here’s
something for you to memorize --
everything you thought you knew
about medicine is wrong. Every rule
you followed, we’ll break.
Everything you thought you could
count on, you can’t. What’s two and
two?
Devon hesitates. Conrad gets in his face.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Six. Because I say so. See, you
already forgot Rule #1. You think
I’m doing this to amuse myself? No.
I’m doing this because you’ve never
touched a patient in your life, and
now you strut in here ready to be a
hero. You grew up watching all
those white coats saving lives on
TV. That magical ER where nobody
ever dies, CPR always works,
patients are all angels, doctors
are gods.
Devon looks away.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Don’t do that.
(gesturing with two
fingers)
Eyes on me. Rule #2. Do whatever
the hell I tell you. No questions
asked. Understood?
DEVON
(cold)
Do you want me to talk now?
Kings County 1/ll/2017 14.
CONRAD
That’s a question.
Devon stares at him, unbending, holding his dignity. Then
turns and walks away. Conrad grabs him, pulls him back.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
My last intern had an attitude too.
You know where he is now? Teaching
8th grade biology. I cut him. Do
you know what that means?
No response.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
It means I can end your career.
Just like that. Remove you from
this residency at any time, for any
reason. And if I do that, no other
residency will take you. You will
have nothing to show for that fancy
Harvard medical school degree
except a mountain of debt.
Devon stares. Is this true?
Conrad smiles, his whole affect changing in a way that is
chilling. He laughs.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Look at the bright side. If you end
up teaching kids to dissect frogs,
at least you’ll have your summers
free. You can take up gardening.
He turns abruptly on his heels.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Now let’s meet your first patient.
He starts off. Devon stands there, stunned.
Conrad looks back, WHISTLES at him like he’s a dog.
Reluctantly, Devon follows.
END COLD OPEN.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 15.
ACT ONE
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PATIENT ROOM - MORNING
Devon and Conrad enter the room of a CROATIAN PATIENT lying
on his side.
CONRAD
Stand there.
Devon follows his outstretched arm.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
No, right there. This is Dobroslav
Charmain. He speaks no English. Has
severe meningitis. What are we
worried about?
Devon is relieved to finally be doing something medical. He
looks at Dobroslav. Notices the position of his legs.
DEVON
Early paralysis.
CONRAD
What is the first sign of
paralysis?
DEVON
Rectal tone.
CONRAD
Perfect. So stick your finger in
his ass. A loose rectum means his
legs may give out soon. Tight means
he’s fine. So we need to know
exactly how tight it is in there.
Devon pulls on gloves. Conrad tosses him a packet of lube.
Devon squeezes it onto his finger.
DEVON
Are you going to explain this to
him or do I just shove my finger up
his--
CONRAD
I just told you he speaks no
English.
DEVON
We could call for a translator.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 16.
CONRAD
And wait three hours for him to
show? Great idea.
Conrad pulls out his phone, types, a modulated voice speaks
in Croatian, subtitles in italics.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
We... must... explore... your
rectum.
Dobroslav looks scared, but nods. With an apologetic
expression, Devon slides in a gloved finger. We don’t see the
finger, but we know what happened.
CONRAD
How tight would you say it is?
DEVON
(cold)
Compared to what?
CONRAD
Your prom date.
Devon stares at him, aghast, his finger up the guy’s butt.
Conrad’s pager goes off.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Stay there until you have an
answer.
He leaves. Devon looks around. Realizing what’s happening, he
immediately withdraws his hand. Tears off the glove, fuming.
INT. PATIENT ROOM - DAY
Conrad enters alone to find an empty bed. He turns and stops
a passing nurse. It’s CLAUDIA from the teaser.
CONRAD
Where’s my appendectomy? He should
be back from recovery by now.
CLAUDIA
That would take a miracle.
CONRAD
What the hell happened?
CLAUDIA
HODAD happened.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 17.
Off Conrad’s reaction.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Bell arrives at the palatial office of the hospital CEO. He
puts on his game face, his usual confident and charismatic
demeanor, walks in.
INT. RENATA’S OFFICE - DAY
Top floor of the hospital. Sweeping view of the Charles
River. The hospital CEO, RENATA LOPEZ (40s), think Ana
Navarro, stands next to her desk. Her attitude is stiff, as
if she knows this will be an unpleasant conversation.
RENATA
Thanks for coming up, Solomon.
BELL
My pleasure, Renata. I was looking
forward to sharing the good news.
The VP from General Electric will
be attending our donor
presentation. With his checkbook.
RENATA
You really do have the Midas touch.
There’d be no new cancer wing
without you. We’re all grateful.
(carefully)
But... I understand there was an
incident this morning.
Bell doesn’t show a flicker of distress.
BELL
Yes, yes. Most unfortunate. Patient
had an undisclosed heart condition.
There was a breakdown in the chain
of command. I was never informed.
RENATA
How could that happen?
BELL
Ask Conrad Hawkins. It was his
patient.
RENATA
That’s surprising. He’s our best
resident.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 18.
BELL
Even the best sometimes make
mistakes.
RENATA
What did you tell the family?
BELL
Initially they requested an
autopsy, but there really was no
need. The cause of death was clear.
RENATA
So you’re not concerned about a
lawsuit.
BELL
The man was living on borrowed
time. He had a ticking time bomb in
his chest.
They hold each other’s gaze for a moment. Renata smiles,
deeply relieved and more than willing to believe it.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR
Bell exits Renata’s office to find Conrad waiting for him.
CONRAD
What was it this time? Pulmonary
embolism?
BELL
Undisclosed heart condition. Tragic
situation. Naturally, I covered for
you.
CONRAD
We’ll see about that.
Conrad starts towards Renata’s office, when Bell blocks his
path, coldly genial.
BELL
Remember that gung ho young doctor
who reported a chemo overdose last
winter? The one that resulted in a
lawsuit that cost the hospital
millions? What happened to her?
Haven’t seen her around in a while.
They hang fire for a moment, then Bell pats Conrad’s arm.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 19.
BELL (CONT’D)
Watch yourself or I won’t cover for
you next time.
Bell walks off, leaving Conrad furious.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PATIENT ROOM - DAY
Devon talks to a MORBIDLY OBESE DIABETIC PATIENT eating a
HAMBURGER. Crumbs fall into the folds of his fat.
DEVON
Looks like you’ve been having some
trouble following your diet.
According to your chart, your
weight has been steadily rising.
The man shrugs. Pops a few fries.
DIABETIC PATIENT
Diets don’t work.
DEVON
Where did you get all this anyway?
DIABETIC PATIENT
Delivery APP.
DEVON
Have you been taking your insulin,
Mr. Dalton?
DIABETIC PATIENT
When I remember.
DEVON
Okay. What brought you to the
hospital today?
DIABETIC PATIENT
My big toe has been hurting for
weeks.
Devon looks down at the socks on his swollen legs. They’re
plastered to his skin by sweat and pus.
DEVON
When was the last time you took off
your socks?
He shrugs. Devon carefully pulls off the sock. The foot is
red, festering with huge ulcers. One of the toes is ENTIRELY
BLACK.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 20.
Devon reaches out to touch the toe. It FALLS OFF, bounces on
the floor. He and the patient stare at it in shock.
DIABETIC PATIENT
What did you just do? Is that my
toe?
DEVON
Severe gangrene... the toe was
already dead. I just touched it.
Conrad pops in. Takes in the scene.
DEVON (CONT'D)
His toe fell off.
DIABETIC PATIENT
He broke off my toe! *
Conrad swipes the burger from the patient’s hands, tosses it
in the trash.
CONRAD
No worries. I was just coming to
tell you we have to amputate the
whole foot.
(to Dev)
We have a new admission.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ER - MOMENTS LATER
Conrad and Devon push through a crowded, bustling ER.
CONRAD
Twenty-one year old girl. History
of IV drug use. Likely endo.
They approach CHLOE GODDARD (21) struggling against several
nurses, trying to rip out her IV. Hair cobalt blue, frail
body swimming in a patient gown, gaunt face twisted with
anger.
Chloe’s distressed lower-middle class MOTHER (30s) and sweetlooking SISTER (15) look on, powerless.
NURSE
She was trying to steal Dilaudid.
And now she wants to leave AMA.
MOTHER
She’s been spiking fevers,
vomiting. Something is wrong with
her.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 21.
SISTER
(weary)
She’s using again. Assuming she
ever quit.
(to Conrad)
She stole everything I made last
summer and spent it on OXY.
CHLOE
You can’t keep me here! Let me go!
Conrad is calm and professional. His voice firm, but
surprisingly reassuring. He takes Chloe’s hands, points to
the tiny red bumps at the tips of her fingers.
CONRAD
See these? Osler’s nodes caused by
bacteria swarming in your blood and
moving through your body. Classic
for Endocarditis.
MOTHER
What’s Endocarditis?
CONRAD
An infection of the heart valve. It
happens to drug users all the time.
Bacteria enters the bloodstream
through a dirty needle and goes
everywhere.
(to Chloe)
If you walk out of here without
antibiotics, this will kill you.
But first you’ll suffer unbearable
pain. You’ll become delirious with
fever. If you give us a chance, we
can save your life.
CHLOE
I’ll stay if you give me 3mg of
Dilaudid. And 25 of Benadryl.
CONRAD
Deal.
MOTHER
No, please don’t give her more
drugs. She’ll get addicted again.
SISTER
Mom, wake up. She’s already
addicted.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 22.
CHLOE
4mg of Dilaudid.
CONRAD
Two. If you get back in bed now.
Conrad takes her arm. She pulls away, then staggers. Fear
flashes on her face. She turns to her mother, suddenly a
child again.
CHLOE
Mommy.
Chloe COLLAPSES onto the floor. Her mother rushes to her.
MOTHER
Chloe, baby!
The sister looks on, suddenly scared. Conrad pushes her
aside, feels Chloe’s neck.
CONRAD
I’m not getting a pulse.
The mother starts to scream. A Nurse reaches for a phone.
NURSE
Code Blue in ED alpha.
The voice rings out overhead. The mother keeps screaming. The
more things escalate, the calmer Conrad becomes. He turns to
Devon, quiet.
CONRAD
Get them out of here.
Devon leads the Mother and sister out as Conrad rips the
girl’s gown off. They leave her on the ground. No time to
move her.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
(to Male Nurse)
Start compressions.
(to Devon as he returns)
You’re running the code.
DEVON
Me? I’ve never run a code.
DOCTORS and NURSES are arriving. Someone wheels a CODE CART.
Another nurse brings a BACK BOARD, which they maneuver under
Chloe’s body as the male nurse continues compressions. The
mother can be heard wailing in the next room.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 23.
MALE NURSE
(to Conrad)
Do you want an amp of bicarb--
CONRAD
(motions to Devon)
He’s in charge.
All of them look expectantly at Devon. Panicked, he fumbles
in his pocket for his INTERN HANDBOOK. Conrad SWATS it out of
his hands, it crashes to the floor.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
What is the first question you ask
in a code?
DEVON
Rhythm.... what’s her rhythm?
One of the nurses checks the monitor.
NURSE
PEA.
CONRAD
Should we shock?
Devon steadies. A life is at stake.
DEVON
No. We can’t. Her rhythm is not
shockable. One of epi. Let’s get
bicarb, amio ready. Have we drawn
labs?
OTHER DOCTOR
On it.
DEVON
Make those compressions harder and
faster.
The team steadies under Devon’s command. His answers are all
correct.
CONRAD
Why did her heart stop beating?
DEVON
She flashed. One of her valves
blew. Is anesthesia on their way?
An ANESTHESIA TEAM arrives.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 24.
DEVON (CONT’D)
Intubate.
They move to do it. Hold on Devon, arms crossed, now
confidently in charge.
LATER
The floor is covered with empty wrappers and syringes. A line
of people stand behind the beleaguered male nurse still
performing compressions. He’s sweating through his scrubs.
Clearly some time has passed.
The ribs CRACK with every compression. Blood begins to spill
out of Chloe’s mouth.
DEVON (CONT’D)
Switch compressions.
Exhausted, the nurse hands over compressions to the next in
line, a MEDICAL STUDENT. The nurse then shuffles to the back
of the line.
CONRAD
It’s been 34 minutes.
Devon ignores Conrad, turns to another DOCTOR.
DEVON
Give another bolus of epi. We’ll do
a rhythm check in one minute.
CONRAD
It’s time to call the code.
DEVON
Not yet. She’s 21 years old.
(to the student doing
compressions)
Harder. You need to feel the ribs
crack.
CONRAD
(pissed now)
That’s enough.
The whole team notices the exchange, watches. They clearly
want to stop, too.
DEVON
NO! I am NOT giving up.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 25.
Conrad reasserts control, walks over to the student doing
compressions. He stops. Devon jerks the student aside, takes
over. He pushes hard and fast on Chloe’s chest.
DEVON (CONT’D)
Is someone going to help with the
pulse and rhythm check?
One of the other doctors reluctantly turns on the cardiac
monitor. To everyone’s shock, they see SINUS RHYTHM. Her
heart is beating again. Devon stops compressions, feels her
neck.
DEVON (CONT’D)
We have a pulse.
(rising)
Let’s get her on a gurney. Keep the
monitor on. And alert the ICU they
have a new admission.
MEDICAL STUDENT
(awestruck)
You saved her life.
As the team moves Chloe onto the gurney, Devon looks right at
Conrad, triumphant. Waits for some acknowledgement, some
admission. Conrad takes a beat, then quietly--
CONRAD
Her end tidal CO2 was less than 15
for the entire code.
Devon absorbs this, pales.
DEVON
That doesn’t necessarily--
CONRAD
Oh yes, it does. She’s been without
oxygen to her brain for 36 minutes.
Congratulations, you saved an
eggplant.
END ACT ONE
Kings County 1/ll/2017 26.
ACT TWO
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ICU - NIGHT
Conrad and Devon look at Chloe. Unconscious. Now hooked up to
a ventilator, covered in IV lines and tubes.
CONRAD
Persistent vegetative state. She’ll
never breathe on her own. Never get
off that vent. Never wake up.
Conrad pulls METAL SCISSORS out of his pocket, digs the flat
end under the nail of Chloe’s index finger deep and hard.
Devon winces just watching. Chloe has absolutely no reaction.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
She can’t feel pain. It’s over.
There’s no coming back from this.
There’s a moment of silence. Devon stares at Chloe,
horrified.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
You came here all bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed, ready to save lives.
But today you didn’t save a life,
you saved a brain stem, because you
didn’t listen to me. Chloe’s gone,
but the repercussions for her
family will go on and on. There is
no way they will accept this.
Devon looks up at Conrad, devastated.
DEVON
I’m sorry.
CONRAD
It’s not going to be that easy.
INT. RESIDENT BREAK ROOM - NIGHT
A GROUP of OTHER INTERNS, including Caleb, stand around
Devon, seated in a chair. Conrad stands with his hand on
Devon’s shoulder, as if they’re buddies.
CONRAD
Devon has kindly volunteered to
serve as your guinea pig, because
he’s passionate about medical
education. Right, Doctor Pravesh?
Kings County 1/ll/2017 27.
Devon swallows and nods.
Conrad removes a coiled NASO-GASTRIC TUBE from its packaging.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
This tube is used to pump food into
the stomachs of patients who can’t
eat. You feed it into the nose and
keep pushing until you hit the
stomach. The procedure hurts. It
triggers the gag reflex, causing
severe nausea. Patients hate it.
They’ll try to pull out the tube.
So you have to tie their hands.
He puts Devon’s hands in restraints. Tightens them. Hard.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Putting it in right takes practice.
So we’re going to practice. On
Devon.
He hands the tube to Caleb.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
You’re up.
Caleb slowly smears the end of the tube in LIDO-LUBE. He
looks at Devon with sympathy, but cares more about looking
tough and competent in front of Conrad.
CALEB
Open up.
Devon says nothing. Just stares up at the ceiling. Caleb
plunges the tip of the tube into his nose. Starts clumsily
shoving it in. Devon gags, immediately nauseous as the tube
hits the back of his nose and bends down his throat.
CONRAD
Keep swallowing.
Devon swallows, chokes. Conrad roughly tilts his head up.
Caleb continues pushing the tube, causing Devon obvious pain
and distress.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Now we feed him.
He gestures to the plunger on a syringe of WHITE SOLUTION
attached to the tubing. Caleb hesitates.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
You need me to do it?
Kings County 1/ll/2017 28.
Caleb shakes his head. Pushes the plunger. The solution
disappears into Devon’s nose. He closes his eyes, grimaces,
choking even more.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Sound of retching from behind a bathroom door. Then Devon
emerges wiping his mouth, shaken. Nic passes him, gives him a
chart.
NIC
PANUTI combo in 405. Running a
fever.
He takes the chart, keeps going, passing a CUTE LITTLE GIRL,
no more than five, lying on a gurney. Her clothes disheveled,
her arm in a sling. She is searching for something in her
blanket.
LITTLE GIRL
Bunny...
She looks scared, is all alone, touches Devon’s white coat as
he passes. He looks down, barely focusing. There’s a stuffed
animal on the floor. He picks it up.
She reaches for it but Devon pulls back. The animal has a
wind up function. He winds it and a lullaby plays. Lovely.
Soothing.
The little girl’s face lights with relief. She reaches for
the toy and whispers.
LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
Thank you, Doctor.
Devon gently tucks in her blanket, squares his shoulders and
rises. Determined, refocusing, he moves on down the hall to
his next patient.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Close on a DA VINCI ROBOTIC SURGERY DEVICE carefully suturing
up the skin of a grape with tiny precise motions.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME TIME
A crowd of DONORS, DEVICE REPS, DOCTORS and MEMBERS OF THE
PRESS are looking at a closed circuit feed from the OR
showing the enormous, multi-armed intimidating device. Renata
stands next to Bell as he speaks.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 29.
BELL
As you can all see, the Titian is
an amazing piece of medical
technology. It translates the
surgeon’s gestures into far smaller
movements. Each of these
infinitesimally, almost
supernaturally precise motions are
more than any pair of human hands
could accomplish.
RENATA
(gushing)
Even Dr. Bell’s.
(to donors)
How about a round of applause for
the man who brought us into the new
age of medicine?
The donors applaud and Bell acknowledges the kudos with false
humility.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ADJACENT ROOM - SAME TIME
CONRAD stands behind glass beside a console where MINA OKAFOR
(30s), a badass Nigerian rising surgical star operates the
device remotely as it’s being filmed. She expertly slices the
newly sutured grape into eight perfectly symmetrical pieces.
Conrad reads out loud from a slick pamphlet.
CONRAD
‘Serious complications may occur up
to and including death. Individual
surgical results may vary.’
MINA
I’ve trained for months to do this.
Results will not vary.
CONRAD
Until HODAD gets his hands on it.
MINA
What’s with that nickname, anyway?
CONRAD
I keep forgetting you’ve only been
here a couple months. HODAD stands
for Hands of Death and Destruction.
Mina glances over, shocked.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 30.
MINA
You’re kidding, right?
CONRAD
I don’t know if it’s age or
inattention, but his complication
rate is terrifying.
MINA
I don’t understand.
CONRAD
I went to a conference on patient
safety once. They asked the doctors
in the room how many knew a surgeon
who shouldn’t be operating. Every
hand went up. There’s a code of
silence that’s seldom broken. The
truth never gets out of the OR.
MINA
Okay, I’m new to this country, but
I find this hard to believe.
CONRAD
Who signs the death certificate?
The doctor. And how likely is it
he’ll write medical error? The only
people who really know the good
surgeons from the bad are the
staff. The administration doesn’t
want to know. They look the other
way.
MINA
What about the patients? Aren’t
there ratings on the internet?
CONRAD
(reading from his phone)
Bell has five stars on Yelp. Top
patient comment. ‘McDreamy is
real.’ Want to hear yours?
MINA
No.
CONRAD
One star.
(reads)
‘Steer clear of Dr. Okafor. She
told me, and I quote, Your uterus
sucks.’
Kings County 1/ll/2017 31.
MINA
It did suck.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ELEVATOR - EVENING
Bell types on his phone. Over his shoulder, we see he’s on
the HEALTH GRADES app, writing his own review under a
pseudonym.
CHYRON: “I just had hernia surgery with Dr. Bell. The man has
magic hands.”
The elevator door opens on the PAVILION FLOOR. Bell quickly
pockets the phone.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PAVILION FLOOR - CORRIDOR - EVENING
We’re in the VIP section of the hospital. Looks like an
entirely different place. The linoleum is gone, so is the
fluorescent lighting. In its place, mahogany-panelled walls,
marble floors, aquascaping.
Bell checks his reflection in a Jasper Johns framed print.
Adjusts his tie. Suddenly struck by inspiration, he pulls out
his phone again--
CHYRON: “And he has great hair.”
INT. PAVILION FLOOR - PATIENT ROOM - EVENING
A beautiful view of the Charles River at magic hour. LYLE
HANCOCK (60s) sits in bed wearing silk pajamas. A tray of
gourmet food on his lap.
A movie plays on the large flat-screen. Lyle looks up as Bell
enters, smiles with relief.
LYLE
Solomon. So glad you’re here.
With a warm, caring smile, Bell sits at the edge of the bed,
slipping effortlessly into his irresistible bedside manner.
BELL
Where else would I be? Better
finish up your smoked oysters. No
food after midnight.
LYLE
They’re truly delicious. This VIP
floor is spectacular.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 32.
BELL
Thanks to you, my friend. After
all, without your generous gift
there would be no new cancer wing.
Bell smiles warmly and takes Lyle’s hand, all concern and
compassion. He is so smooth, there’s no way Lyle could know
he’s about to be played.
BELL (CONT’D)
Have you met your surgeon?
LYLE
No, actually. I understand it’s a
woman.
BELL
Dr. Okafor, yes.
(beat)
She’s Nigerian.
LYLE
(frowns)
Oh.
Bell lets that information settle.
BELL
Here on a Visa. A very promising
young resident. I have to admit,
I’m a little surprised she hasn’t
been in to see you yet.
LYLE
Is that unusual?
BELL
Let’s just say it’s not reassuring.
LYLE
What do you mean she’s a “young”
resident?
BELL
Second year, I believe.
LYLE
Not an attending?
BELL
I’m afraid not.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 33.
LYLE
(annoyed)
I spoke directly to the CEO. She
told me Dr. Okafor was the best
possible surgeon to remove my
prostate with the Titian.
BELL
I’m sure she’ll do fine. Fairly
certain.
LYLE
Let’s slow this train down,
Solomon. You’re the doctor I trust.
You did my biopsy. You handled
those unexpected complications so
brilliantly.
BELL
Just tell me what you want, Lyle.
(takes his hand, leaning
in)
I’m here for you.
LYLE
(huffy)
I want you to do the surgery.
You’re the Chief of Surgery, right?
I forked over two million dollars.
For that kind of money, don’t I get
the Chief?
BELL
Yes, of course, but the request
should really come from you, not
me. Talk to Renata, our CEO. She
can make it happen.
INT. NURSES STATION - NIGHT
Nic is typing while intermittently glancing across the ward
at CONRAD, with the beautiful TINDER PATIENT seen earlier. If
Nic’s jealous, she’s trying not to show it.
Devon approaches, follows her gaze.
DEVON
He’s a psychopath.
NIC
Let’s say your car has a rattle.
You take it to a mechanic.
(MORE)
Kings County 1/ll/2017 34.
The mechanic is a rude, dismissive
bastard but he tightens a bolt,
fixes the car, and charges five
bucks. Problem solved. Or you could
take the same car with the same
rattle to a different mechanic.
This one is nice, polite, eager to
help. He runs tests for two days,
then tells you the repair will set
you back a thousand bucks. You sell
your comic book collection to pay
the guy, and on the way home you
hear the same rattle.
DEVON
This isn’t like that--
NIC
No. Because your car can’t end up
dead.
(beat, then firm)
Watch and learn. Conrad is the guy
who tightens the bolt.
Nic walks off passing Conrad, who is exiting the room of the
Tinder Patient.
CONRAD
What do you think of her?
NIC
(evenly)
You could do better.
He takes one beat and pulls Nic into...
INT. CALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kisses her hard against door. Nic’s eyes grow wide. Conrad
turns, realizes they’re not alone. Sitting on the bottom bunk
is Tasso, pants around his knees. He looks up at them,
humiliated.
CONRAD
Get out.
He pulls up his pants, scurries out. Conrad and Nic instantly
go back at it. Hot and hungry.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - NURSE’S STATION - DAY
Devon is reading a text from Priya.
NIC (CONT'D)
Kings County 1/ll/2017 35.
CHYRON: I miss you. How’s it going?
Devon smiles, writes back. CHYRON: I’m re-thinking law
school.
PRIYA’S CHYRON: You’re going to be an amazing doctor. You
will make a difference.
He’s about to respond when A CODE SOUNDS. Devon looks up.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CALL ROOM - DAY
They’re still going at it.
OVERHEAD (O.S.)
Code Blue on 9 west.
NIC
(pulling back)
That’s surgery. HODAD’S ward.
Conrad BREAKS AWAY, pulls himself together and exits.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - HALLWAYS - DAY
Devon is running to the code when he passes Conrad, standing
at a kitchen station marked “FOR PATIENTS ONLY. NO STAFF.”
Devon stops, watches Conrad whistling as he fills a plastic
bucket with ice.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PATIENT ROOM - DAY
Bell is surrounded by a crowd of nurses. His patient, a 40
YEAR OLD WOMAN, is the one coding. Nic enters.
NIC
Status.
NURSE #1
We pushed adenosine 6 mg, then 12.
She flatlined, then came back! But
she’s still tach’ing away at 180.
BELL
(with authority)
Try Posicor.
NIC
Uh, that drug was recalled in 2007.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 36.
The door bursts open and we see Conrad holding the ICE
BUCKET. Devon is right behind him.
CONRAD
I think her heart has had enough AV
blockade.
Conrad THROWS THE ICE WATER OVER THE PATIENT’S FACE. Devon
reacts. HOLY SHIT. Bell spins on Conrad.
BELL
Are you INSANE?!
NIC
(at the monitor)
Normal rhythm.
They all look. Incredibly, the patient’s heartbeat is back.
CONRAD
(to Devon, matter-of-fact)
Ice water stimulus. Prompts a vagal
tone, restores normal rhythm in
adenosine-refractory SVT. Called
the Diver’s Reflex.
The woman sputters awake. Conrad looks right at Bell.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Two in one day would be excessive.
He walks off. Bell doesn’t miss a beat. Leaps to his
patient’s side.
BELL
There, there, Mrs. Foster.
Everything’s going to be all right.
MRS. FOSTER
Dr. Bell... you saved my life.
Devon looks from Bell, the famous surgeon, to his retreating
supervising resident. Nic smiles at Devon on her way out,
like “told ya’.”
ON DEVON... beginning to get it.
END ACT TWO
Kings County 1/ll/2017 37.
ACT THREE
EXT. KINGS COUNTY - NIGHT
Middle of the night. The facade is alight, but the entrance
is quiet.
EXT. KINGS COUNTY - ROOF - NIGHT
DEVON seated against a wall eating a sandwich, his dinner.
He’s scrolling images on his phone:
Most are of PRIYA. In bed, smiling at him, at the beach, at
the wheel of her Tesla. But we also see DEVON with his
BROTHER who wears a military uniform and DEVON’S FATHER
standing by his YELLOW CAB.
He lands on one LAST IMAGE. HIS MOTHER IN A SARI with his
FATHER -- the two of them flanking him at his medical school
graduation. They look proud. He looks happy.
In the distance a SIREN SCREAMS.
EXT. KINGS COUNTY - ER ENTRANCE - NIGHT
An ambulance arrives. Paramedics jump out and start unloading
LILY EVANS (24), pale, vulnerable, bald but beautiful in an
ethereal way. Shivering under a pile of blankets.
Her fiance ROSS (31) emerges with her and walks alongside the
gurney. He’s tall, strong, athletic -- the kind of guy who
could get any girl he wanted.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ER - NIGHT
The doors BANG OPEN as the paramedics guide the gurney, one
hands Lily’s chart to a MALE NURSE.
PARAMEDIC
Acute leukemic, on chemo, fiance
called because she was shaking
uncontrollably.
ROSS
She spiked a fever this morning.
100.8. Also some vomiting. No blood
in it. Last chemo was a week ago.
The male nurse moves to put in an IV, as the paramedics guide
her into a bay.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 38.
ROSS (CONT’D)
Best place is her right forearm.
And she has an allergy to
tetrayclines.
Conrad and Devon emerge from the elevator, thread their way
through patients waiting on gurneys, find Lily’s bed.
CONRAD
Lily.
She looks up, relieved to see a familiar face.
LILY
Dr. Hawkins. I’m sorry to be back
so soon.
CONRAD
Not as sorry as we are.
Unexpectedly, Conrad takes both her hands in his, locks eyes
with her, almost tender.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
Looks like another infection.
(re the touch of her
hands)
You’re running a fever.
ROSS
The chemo is still crushing her
immune system.
DEVON
Febrile neutropenia.
Conrad nods, takes over the IV flushing from the nurse.
CONRAD
We’ll start you on broad-spectrum
antibiotics again. Tylenol to get
your fever down. I’ll call Dr.
Hunter.
(to Devon)
Lily’s oncologist. Very hands on.
One of the top specialists here.
Always wants to be the first one
notified if one of her patients is
admitted.
DEVON
Got it.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 39.
CONRAD
Get cultures from both arms. Urine.
Include a fungal plate. Don’t
worry, Lily, we’ll get this under
control and you’ll be home soon.
He starts out, gestures for Devon to follow.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Devon and Conrad walk and talk.
CONRAD
You may have noticed that a lot of
our patients are a pain in the ass.
But Lily? She’s why you became a
doctor. With any luck, we can save
her. I’m giving you a gift. From
now on, she’s your patient. But if
you screw up this one, I will wreck
you.
Devon absorbs this. Sees Ross approaching with Lily’s
OVERNIGHT BAG. Moves towards him.
DEVON
Lily will go to the 11th floor
after her CT. You can meet her up
there.
Ross hesitates. He passes the bag to Devon.
ROSS
Her favorite wig is in there. She’s
going to want to put it on as soon
as she’s feeling better. Her phone
is in the side pocket. She should
call her mom.
DEVON
You’re not coming up?
ROSS
This has been my life for the last
six months. I can’t sleep. When I
do, I have nightmares. Do you know
what it’s like to spend every
waking hour trying to fix something
you can’t fix?
Ross looks away. This big guy is about to cry. The pain in
his face is overwhelming.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 40.
ROSS (CONT’D)
I can’t do it anymore.
He walks off, leaving Devon holding Lily’s overnight bag.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Mina, removing her scrub cap and mask, passes Nic.
MINA
I don’t have time to give updates
on how the surgeries went one by
one. Are the families all
assembled?
NIC
Dr. Okafor... I think they might
find that jarring.
MINA
Better to rip off the band-aid.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Three families are huddled in different parts of the waiting
room. One is large, Latino. Another upper-class -- a middleaged white woman in Chanel and pearls with her adult daughter
and son. The last is two Indian women in saris.
Dr. Okafor enters. The families all look up expectantly.
MINA
(to the Latino family)
Luis is doing fine. He’s in
recovery.
(to the Indian family)
Raj is in the ICU. It’s touch and
go.
(to Chanel)
Prescott’s dead.
She turns, walks out. Off the families, reeling.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
Bell finds Mina, now out of scrubs, reaching for her backpack
in her locker. She’s in her full badass after-hours gear --
high-heeled boots, Commes Des Garcons pants and a leather
bomber jacket.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 41.
BELL
Dr. Okafor -- a word?
MINA
Sorry, on my way out. I need rest
for the robot prostatectomy
tomorrow morning.
BELL
That’s actually why I’m here. The
patient has requested a last minute
change in the lineup.
MINA
The lineup?
BELL
As you know, Lyle’s an important
donor and keeping our VIPs happy is
our top priority. He’s always been
my patient. He asked for me.
MINA
Does he have a death wish?
Now Bell’s eyes go cold, but his voice remains smooth.
BELL
I hear you’re applying for an O1
visa. You’ll need a letter of
recommendation from your
supervisor. I believe that would be
me.
MINA
(recalculating)
Dr. Bell, you’ve never touched the
Titian. I trained on it for 80
hours. That’s how long it takes to
become proficient. You cannot do
that surgery. As in, it’s literally
impossible.
BELL
You have no idea what’s possible.
MINA
Eighty hours, Dr. Bell. The surgery
is first thing tomorrow morning.
BELL
This isn’t a discussion. I
anticipate a flawless presentation.
We’ll be streaming live--
Kings County 1/ll/2017 42.
MINA
(aghast)
You want witnesses?
His face hardens. She’s pushing too far.
MINA (CONT’D)
I have to draw a line here, Doctor.
This can’t happen. It’s too risky.
For you. And for the patient.
BELL
Then I suppose you’ll be heading
back to Abuja. Given the political
unrest in Nigeria, and the quality
of healthcare available there, you
might want to reconsider.
Off Mina, fucked.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - LILY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Devon watches as Lily puts on a convincing blonde wig. We
can’t help but notice the resemblance to the blonde on his
phone. Her overnight bag lies open on the floor.
LILY
He’s gone, right?
DEVON
I’m sure tomorrow he’ll--
LILY
No. He won’t. It’s okay. It’s been
coming for a while. Ross didn’t
sign up for cancer. I was diagnosed
a month after we got engaged. I
should’ve let him go... but I
didn’t want to die alone.
She says it simply, but the words cut like a knife.
DEVON
(gently)
He said you should call your
mother.
LILY
She lost her brother to cancer.
Can’t handle this. Besides, she’s
in Phoenix. What are my numbers?
Kings County 1/ll/2017 43.
DEVON
Your ANC was 750.
LILY
Lower than usual.
DEVON
Yes. Urine dipstick showed
bacteria.
LILY
Another bladder infection.
DEVON
We’ve got you on antibiotics. It’ll
get better quickly.
LILY
Until next time.
She climbs into bed and pulls the sheets up like a child.
Devon’s pager goes off. She looks up at him, pale and
vulnerable.
LILY (CONT’D)
Do you have to leave right away?
Devon considers a moment, silences the pager.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
Bell sits at the surgical console for the Titian machine.
Mina watches, eating from a bag of CHERRIES.
MINA
Start with a simple maneuver. Four
millimeter incision on the ventral
surface.
The robot’s eight arms hover over a CHERRY positioned in the
center of the surgical bed.
MINA (CONT’D)
Slow and steady.
BELL
(irritated)
I got it.
One of the arms, wielding a very sharp scalpel, suddenly
whips around clattering into the overhead light, then knocks
instruments off a nearby tray, landing on the floor with a
crash.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 44.
The arm veers back to the operating bed, slams down, missing
the cherry by nearly a foot. Flies back up, then down again,
pulverizing the cherry. Red juice splatters Bell’s white
coat.
BELL (CONT’D)
What’s the hell’s wrong with this
machine? Isn’t it supposed to make
it easier?
MINA
Once you’re trained. In the
meantime, it will be better... for
everyone... if I do this.
His vulnerability instantly disappears.
BELL
No. The patient wants me. I can do
this. I’m a quick study.
She calmly puts down another cherry.
MINA
Round eleven.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - LILY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Devon and Lily are in mid-conversation. Now he’s sitting on
her bed, showing her pictures of Priya and himself at an
Indian wedding on his phone.
LILY
She’s pretty.
DEVON
And smart. She could spend her life
island hopping if she wanted to.
Her father owns resorts all over
the world. But she devotes herself
to charity work. My dad’s a cab
driver. I’m the first in my family
to go to college, let alone medical
school.
LILY
She’s lucky. You both are.
(sadness in her eyes)
Ross and I met in law school. He
was dating my best friend. She was
in love with him and I stole him
away. They’d probably be married if
it weren’t for me.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 45.
Lily looks away, a wave of guilt.
LILY (CONT’D)
Sometimes I think the cancer is
payback.
Lily’s monitor blinks. A new blood pressure flashes. Devon
notices immediately.
DEVON
Lily, how are you feeling?
LILY
A bit weak all of a sudden.
DEVON
Your blood pressure is low. 80 over
40. It was 120 over 90 a minute
ago.
Devon’s eyes are fixed on the monitor. He goes to the door,
grabs NIC as she passes by.
DEVON (CONT’D)
Page Lily’s oncologist, Dr. Hunter.
NIC
She’s at a formal dinner getting
some kind of award.
He looks back at the monitor as it BEEPS a warning.
DEVON
Where’s Conrad?
NIC
An emergency in the ER.
DEVON
Lily’s BP is 70 over 38. And
dropping.
Lily’s head suddenly slumps on her pillow. She’s unconscious.
DEVON (CONT’D)
Call a rapid response. Now!
Nic runs down the hallway.
END ACT THREE
Kings County 1/ll/2017 46.
ACT FOUR
INT. LILY’S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT
Lily is now surrounded by Nic and other nurses. The scene is
controlled chaos, the highest urgency. Devon is at the center
of the whirlwind.
DEVON
Get a CBC, CMP, LFTs, lactate. Have
we got both IVs running wide open?
Nic finishes hanging an IV bag.
NIC
Yes. Systolic is fluctuating, but
it’s not good.
DEVON
We’re three liters in already.
Sepsis.
NIC
Do you want to give levo
peripherally?
DEVON
No. Lily needs the big guns.
Central line kit.
NIC
You’ve never done one.
DEVON
We can’t wait. We’ll lose her.
Nic reluctantly hands him the central line kit and he grabs
an iodine swab, swabs the area around Lily’s neck vein. Holds
out his hand. Nic passes him the scalpel.
He pauses and they both look at the blade. So sharp. He puts
the knife to Lily’s delicate neck and...
The door BURSTS OPEN and an elegant woman in formal dress
enters. This is DR. LANE HUNTER.
LANE
What in the name of God is going on
here?
NIC
(huge relief)
Dr. Hunter.
(MORE)
Kings County 1/ll/2017 47.
Lily needs a central line. This is
Dr. Pravesh, Conrad’s new intern.
He’s never done one.
Devon steps back. Lane looks to Devon as she pulls on her
white coat.
LANE
(firm, calm)
Proceed Dr. Pravesh.
NIC
No, seriouslyLANE
I said proceed. You can do it.
Devon hesitates, then returns to Lily. Goes to cut again...
but the pressure is worse with Lane and everyone else
watching. This time as he puts the blade to Lily’s neck his
hand trembles.
Lane sees and without judgement simply puts her hand over his
to steady him. He looks up. Their eyes meet. In hers he sees
total reassurance. She removes her hand, nods.
Devon looks down, his hand no longer shakes. He cuts in one
swift, clean move. Now he exchanges the central line over the
guide-wire. Lane watches, approving.
LANE (CONT’D)
Excellent. Nice and clean. You’re a
natural. What now?
DEVON
(to Nic)
Start at five mg. Slowly titrate up
as necessary.
Nic looks to Lane for confirmation, gets it. She does it.
They wait, watching the monitor together as Lily’s blood
pressure begins to stabilize.
DEVON (CONT’D)
When her pressure levels out, wean
her off the levo and drown her in
fluids.
Nic nods. Lane touches Devon’s shoulder lightly.
LANE
Well done, Doctor.
NIC (CONT'D)
Kings County 1/ll/2017 48.
EXT. KINGS COUNTY - DAWN
The sun is rising behind the vast complex. The long night is
over.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - DAWN
Devon stands looking out at the rising sun. The light bathes
his face and in it we see hope. A new day. He made it.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - LILY’S ROOM - DAWN
Devon enters to check on Lily, finds Lane by her side,
checking her monitors.
DEVON
You’ve been here all night.
Lane stays focused on Lily, doesn’t answer. She touches her
tenderly. Lily stirs, smiles.
LANE
Lily. You gave us quite a scare.
But you’re going to be fine. The
bleeding was from a blast crisis.
It doesn’t mean you’re getting
sicker. It means you’re getting
better. How do you feel?
LILY
Hungry, Dr. Hunter.
LANE
That we can fix. I have rounds now
so I’m going to leave you in the
capable hands of Dr. Pravesh.
LILY
Good, I like him.
LANE
Me too.
Lane smiles at Devon, gestures for him to follow her out of
the room.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - MORNING
They come out together. Stop and stand in the warm sunlight.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 49.
DEVON
I’m sorry we had to call you out of
the award ceremony.
LANE
I wouldn’t have it any other way.
The last thing I need is more
crystal.
(beat, looks right at him)
I read your file, Devon. I’m
impressed. I want you to consider
me a mentor. If you have any
problems, come to me. Who’s your
supervising resident?
DEVON
Doctor Conrad Hawkins.
LANE
You’re lucky. Conrad’s one of the
best doctors in the hospital.
DEVON
So they tell me.
She reads between the lines as he looks away.
LANE
I know. He can be rough. There are
reasons for that.
(beat)
Believe it or not, he used to be
you.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - MORNING
Mina walks down the hallway. She’s headed to the operation.
Nic catches up.
NIC
Tell me this isn’t really
happening.
MINA
It’s happening.
NIC
HODAD is going to eviscerate one of
the hospital’s biggest donors, and
no one is stepping in to stop him?
Mina doesn’t answer, eyes straight ahead as she walks off.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 50.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - PHARMACY - MORNING
Bell rubs his eyes, addresses the pharmacist.
BELL
Provigil 20 mg. And I’ll take a
couple Adderall. I’ve got a big
surgery and I have to focus. I’ve
been up all night.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - SCRUB ROOM - MORNING
Bell, now very up, talking fast, is being filmed as he scrubs
in. His hands tremble. He looks into the camera:
BELL
We’re five minutes away from the
maiden voyage of our new Titian
robot. After spending considerable
time working with it, I can
definitively say this is a
miraculous machine.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
A crowd, including Conrad, has gathered to watch the live
stream of the surgery.
ON SCREEN BELL CONTINUES
BELL (CONT’D)
We expect it to be particularly
useful for prostatectomies, which
is what we’re doing today.
They see Bell sit at the robot console as the machine lights
up. The donor is already stretched out on the table, his
abdomen exposed.
Nic stands next to Conrad.
NIC
I can’t watch.
CONRAD
I can’t look away.
The ROBOT ARMS slowly position themselves over the open
abdomen.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 51.
BELL
We access the prostate through the
abdomen. It’s buried under the
bowels, at the base of the bladder.
A small, sensitive organ.
Now the ARMS move organs aside, exposing a walnut-shaped
structure.
BELL (CONT’D)
The prostate has to be carefully
peeled off the urethra and the
bladder. The risk of rupture and
bleeding is high in unskilled
hands.
As we watch the robot tools move with surprising precision--
BELL (CONT’D)
You can see the robotic instruments
are smaller than your fingernails.
But that blade is sharper than
number 11. There are rat tooth and
plier modules as well.
Back now to a CU of BELL. His hands, off screen, appear to
move in tiny and precise motions as he concentrates hard.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - OPERATING ROOM - SAME TIME
We now see that Bell’s hands are not touching anything. His
console has no controls. Mina sits behind him at the actual
console, just off-camera for the live feed. She is the one
performing the surgery.
Bell’s arms wave in space.
BELL
This represents the union of human
ingenuity and cutting edge
technology. Man and machine are
melded, working as one.
Mina rolls her eyes.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - CORRIDOR - LATER
Bell hands Mina an envelope.
BELL
Welcome to America.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 52.
MINA
It’s everything I imagined it would
be.
The hospital CEO, Renata, approaches as Mina walks off. She
embraces Bell, beaming.
RENATA
Amazing, Dr. Bell. I have to admit
I’m a bit stunned at how fast you
mastered such advanced technology.
BELL
It was a breeze. Practically
operates itself.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ICU - MORNING
Conrad talks to Chloe’s mother who has brought her daughter’s
childhood Teddy bear and blanket and spent the night in her
room. Chloe’s sister stands with the doctors, as if on their
side.
CONRAD
This is hard to hear, I know. But
there is no doubt that your
daughter will never wake up. Neuro
has checked her out extensively and
confirmed brain death.
MOTHER
Her heart is beating.
CONRAD
Because of these machines. If we
disconnect the vent--
MOTHER
You want to kill my child?
We now see Devon is listening in the doorway.
SISTER
You can’t kill her, Mom. She’s
already dead.
MOTHER
I’m not giving up. It hasn’t even
been 24 hours.
CONRAD
Two weeks won’t make a difference.
Nor will two years.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 53.
MOTHER
She could live that long?
CONRAD
If you call that living. She’ll
never look at you, speak to you,
have a thought or a feeling, take a
breath on her own, know day from
night. But if you leave her on life
support, her body could continue
like this for decades. You’ll spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars on
medical care. Insurance won’t cover
it. You could lose your home, your
life savings.
MOTHER
I’m not killing my child.
The mother guides the sister out, passing Devon in the
doorway. She looks up at him--
MOTHER (CONT’D)
We’ll be in the cafeteria if she
wakes up.
Once they’re gone, Devon looks to Conrad.
DEVON
This is my fault. If there’s
anything I can do--
CONRAD
Go home.
Devon turns, walks away.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Devon leans against a wall, devastated. Conrad approaches,
studies Dev a moment. Then he pulls out his wallet, removes a
photo of a little girl. Hands it to Devon.
CONRAD
Annabeth. Five. She had cancer. I
made a mistake. Gave her too much
potassium. She died. From me, not
the cancer.
Devon looks at him, questioning, but Conrad offers nothing
more. He takes back the photo, returns it to his wallet.
Kings County 1/ll/2017 54.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
If it were easy, everyone would be
a doctor because this is the best
job in the world. Despite
everything. Because of everything.
Devon slowly nods.
CONRAD (CONT’D)
I’ll see you tomorrow.
Devon walks off.
INT. KINGS COUNTY - ICU - NIGHT
Chloe’s body is being artificially inflated by the
ventilator. Her chest rises and falls. Her eyes are empty.
CLOSE ON the ventilator. A hand shuts the machine off.
Chloe’s chest ceases rising and falling. In a few moments,
she convulses.
ON CONRAD WATCHING WITHOUT EXPRESSION.
Chloe’s lips turn blue. Saliva rattles at the back of her
throat. It goes on.
CONRAD just watches. Waits. The rattling subsides. Chloe’s
body relaxes. Then is still. Totally still.
Conrad takes her pulse to be sure. Then turns the machine
back on.
Chloe’s chest rises and falls as the breath is mechanically
forced into her lungs. Her eyes stay open, staring at
nothing. Her lips remain blue. Conrad exits. The halls are
empty. No one sees him. He walks off.
FADE OUT.
THE END
Kings County 1/ll/2017 55.
