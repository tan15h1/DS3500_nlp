FADE IN:
1 INT. COLD OPEN, BEDROOM -- MORNING l
As the clock turns· to 6:00 AM, the alarm goes off. JOHN
DORIAN, "J.D." to his friends immediately reaches out and
turns it off. J.D. is 25, boyishly handsome, self
deprecatingly funny, likeable, and would probably be more
self-confident if he realized any of that. As he gets out
of bed, WE HEAR HIS VOICEOVER:
J .D (V .0.)
Since I was eleven years old, I've been
able to sleep through anything. Storms,
earthquakes, my girlfriend yelling at me
to "Open the door or we're through," you
name it.
2 INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS ... 2
WE SEE J.D. ENTER, start to undress ...
J .D (V .0.)
Last night I didn't sleep.
3 OMITTED 3
4 INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 4
J.D. is now in front of the mirror, towel around his waist,
shaving cream in one hand.
J .D (V .0.)
·r
guess I get a little goofy when I'm
nervous.
TIME CUT TO:
J.D. in a towel in front of the mirror, his body and face
covered with shaving cream a~ if it were warpaint.
J.D (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You see, today isn't just any other day ...
ANGLE ON J.D. 's hand as he turns on the radio.
TIME CUT TO:
PULL BACK to see J.D. now dressed in hospital scrubs, looking
at himself in the mirror.
J.D (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's my first day.
MUSIC CUE....
SCRUBS PINK 1
J.D.
(to mirror)
I'm the man.
5 EXT. SACRED HEART HOSPITAL MOMENTS LATER 5*
The music still plays as J.D. walks toward the entrance.
The hospital itself is so old and depressing that it probably
can't even remember its better days.
J. D (V .0.)
And four years of pre-med, four years of
med school, and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in unpaid loans have finally made
me realize one important thing ...
6 INT. ER/ADMISSIONS' -- CONTINUOUS 6
J.D. CASUALLY ENTERS through a sliding glass door. What he.,
sees is akin to being dropped in Vietnam, patients are whisked
by, children crying; This is a real hospital with much
commotion. As J.D. takes this in, a frantic NURSE'APPEARS, *
surprising him. *
NURSE KEARNEY *
Good, could you go drop a N.G. tube on
the patient in 234 and call the attending
if the lavage is positive?
J.D.
(beat)
Sure.
J. D (V. 0.)
I don't know jack.
AS J.D. STANDS THERE, CLUELESS: END OF COLD OPEN.
FADE OUT:SCRUBS PINK 2
ACT ONE
7 INT. ER/ADMISSIONS - CONTINUOUS 7
J.D. still stands next to the nurse.
J.D. (V.O.)
So, this is my story ...
J.D
I'm supposed to be up in intensive care-
NURSE KEARNEY *
Good. We just turfed him there.
(explaining)
we transferred him to I.c.u.
J.D.
Was this before you turfed him?
NURSE KEARNEY *
That's what turfing means.
J.D.
I know that. I'm just having some fun
with you. Woo-hoo ...
The nurse stares at him, skeptically.
J. D (V .0.)
Look, I got into medicine because I always
wanted to help people, but orientation
yesterday didn't really focus on patient
care ...
CUT TO:
8 INT~ CONFERENCE ROOM - THE DAY BEFORE 8
The hospital LAWYER drones on in front of a room filled with
soon-to-be interns. On the chalkboard he's written the word
LAWSUITS and drawn an X through it.
LAWYER
The hospital doesn't want to be sued, you
don't want to be sued - let's be honest,
no one likes being sued. Being sued is
not .a good thing ...
J.D. sits next to CHRIS TURK, 25, black, handsome, with the
quiet confidence of a man who can't be flustered. Turk and
J.D. speak with the familiarity of old friends.
J.D.
Turk, You know how I'm totally down with
the rap music ...
TURK
Dude, be whiter.
WE FREEZE FRAME on TURK:
(CONTINUED)SCRUBS YELLOW 3*
J .D (V. 0.) *
Chris Turk is my best friend. We *
roomed together in college.
*
SA EXT. - DAY SA*

Two shot of Turk and J.D. (with mullet and flat top) when *
they were college freshman. (William and Mary sweatshirt,
etc.)
*
SB EXT. - DAY BB*

Two shot of Turk and J.D. in med school in similar pose. *
*
J .D (V .O.) *
We roomed together in med school. *
*
BC EXT. - DAY BC*
*
Two shot of J.D. and Turk six weeks ago. *
J .D (V .O.) *
· Hell, we even got .accepted by the *
same hospital. ·
*
J.D. and Turk hold envelopes, celebrating their acceptance. *
They hug then part, both extremely uncomfortable.
*
BACK TO FREEZE-FRAME OF TURK *
CUT TO: *
9 OMITTED 9*
10 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 10
Back on FREEZE FRAME of Turk reacting, then:
J.D.
Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre
in most of their songs, these artists use
an extremely volatile word--
TURK
Nigger. Yes, I am aware of that..•
SCRUBS PINK 4
J.D.
My question is this. If we're both singing
along, and knowing that otherwise I'd
never use the word, am I allowed to say--
TURK
No.
J.D.
But what if-
TURK
Nooe.
J.D.
See, that's good to know.·
ANGLE ON the Lawyer, who has now writte~ on the chalkboard:
ALCOHOL + SURGERY = NO-NO. He UNDERLINES No-No. ·~ *
LAWYER
... Finally Doctors, if you make a mistake, '
call me. Please, don't admit it to the
patient, or the patient's faniil¥,
especially if there is a death involved.
Of course, if the patient is deceased,
you can feel free to tell him or her
anything.
The Lawyer LAUGHS. No one else does.
J.D.
So, hey, I found us an apartment-
J.D. is interrupted by CHIEF OF MEDICINE ROBERT KELSO, 56,
he is a kind looking man with loads of •aw shucks' charm.
DR. KELSO
Listen up gang, I'm Dr. Bob Kelso, and
I'm your chief of medicine. We've got
some exciting times ahead, gang, so I
want you to think of me as your safety
net, because I promise you, we are a family
here. Now,. I bought pizza in case you'd
like to stick around and touch base with
your fe1·1ow interns. Go get • em, doctors.
COT TO:
11 INT. PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER · 11
The penthouse is a room with a few ratty couches, an old tv,
a small table and an old PAC MAN video game currently in
use. J.D. and Turk eat pizza and watch.
J.D.
Can I sing black magic woman?SCRUBS PINK 5
TURK
You can hum it .
,,----,,
l-., ( then)
. '
I ( So the surgical interns are gonna go grab
a beer.
J.D.
l
The medical interns are having a Pac-Man
tournament. Apparently we're all twelve.
ELLIOT (O.S.)
I love Pac-,Man.
The guys turn to see ELLIOT REID, 26, an attractive, *
extremely driven young woman, so much so that she seem~ to
live at a slightly quicker pace than normal humans. She's
also the t¥Pe of girl that could make the world stop if she
let her hair down. It's down right now. *
J.D.
Me too. I love playing it, I love watching
it played. I just love it.
ELLIOT
I'm Elliot.
TURK
(Finger out, a'la
E.T.}
Ellliioott ...
ELLIOT
Yeah, don't do that.
J.D.
I'm J.D., this is Turk.
TURK
So, Elliot ... you medical or surgery?
TIME SLOWS. J.D. and Turk look at each other, then back to
Elliot. Finally:
ELLIOT
·Medical.
AS TURK REACTS and WE HEAR A PAC-MAN DIE:
CUT TO: .
12 INT. CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER 12
J.D. and Elliot walk up to I.C.U. Elliot gradually increases
the pace.
ELLIOT
So every male in my family is a doctor.
My dad, my granddad, my brother. Guess
that's why Dad gave me a guy's name, made
me play sports, date girls, I'm joking.SCRUBS BLUE

J.D.
I know, I would've laughed if you had
paused.
ELLIOT
Good. It was funny. So, Turk's cute.
J .D (V. O.)
If she likes Turk, so be it.
J.D.
He's getting married.
ELLIOT
Anyway, I got better board scores than
Gramps, my dad, and my stupid brother ... I
know what you're thinking.
J. D (V. 0.)
Your butt looks like two pringles next to
each other.
No you don't.
13 INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS 13
ELLIOT
The whole having-to-be-the-best thing,
Miss "Hyper competitive," I mean it used
to be a big problem for me, used to, past
tense ...
J.D.
(stops)
Hey. Are we racing?
Elliot gives him an "Are you crazy" look, then:
ELLIOT
Yes.
She TAKES OFF up the stairs. J.D. races after her.
14 INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 14
In J .D. 1.s fantasy, he now wears a MARATHONER'S OUTFIT. He
RUNS past doctors and nurses, even takes a cup of coffee
from one and POURS it over his own head. Finally, at the
I.C.U. ward, J.D. PASSES ELLIOT and BREAKS THE FINISH LINE
TAPE FIRST. A WOMAN IN A WALKER comes in third.
15 INT. I.C.U. NURSES STATION -- CONTINUOUS 15
BACK TO REALITY. J.D. bends over, gasps for breath. Elliot
is not the least bit tired.
ELLIOT
So, you do a lot of cardio?.•
SCRUBS PINK 7
Too tired to speak, J.D. MOUTHS 11YES11 SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT*
•
JEFFREY STEADMAN,29, ENTERS. He is truly a weasel. *
JEFFERY
Elliot Reid and John Dorian?
*
(off nods, not thrilled)
Great. One, I am your resident, Dr.
Jeffery Steadman, not Jeff. Two, here
are your Manuals ..._
He hands them both an Intern Manual (universal text of basic
procedures given to all interns).
JEFFERY (CONT'D)
These can answer any basic questions you
have so don't bother me, ever, kay? Three,
don't be a moron and open your manual up
in front of a patient, Four ...
J. D. (V. 0.)
You ever notice how quickly some people
make an impression?
Note:· In the following dialogue, what we hear does not match
Jeffery's mouth movements, it's just what J.D. hears.
JEFFERY·
I'm a tool, I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, *
tool, tool, unbelievably annoying tool.
*
J.D.
Yeah.
JEFFERY
Finally, these are your beepers. From
now on, these control your life, kay?
J.D; stares at the beeper in his hand. It goes off.
MATCH CUT TO:
16 INT. ER/ADMISSIONS - PRESENT TIME 16
J.D. is where we left him earlier, next to the same nurse,
staring at his beeper.
J.D.
Sorry, gotta go.
CUT TO:
17 INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 17
J.D. catches up to NURSE CARLA ESPINOZA, who is pushing an
older patient quickly down the hall on a gurney.· She is
·Hispanic, thirtyish, painfully frank, and manages to be
mothe:rly and sexy at the same time.SCRUBS PINK

J.D.
I was beeped ...
CARLA
Aww, first day Bambi? Carla will take
care of you - don't look at me when we're
moving someone.
J.D. walks into some equipment, FALLS OUT OF FRAME. Hops
up, and follows Carla into a room.
18 INT. PATIENT'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 18
CARLA
We're waiting for Dr. Cox ...
DR. PHIL cox ENTERS. He is an ATTENDING PHYSICIAN in his
late-thirties, and a steamroller of a man.
J.D.
Hi, Dr., I'm--
DR. COX
Place an I.V. for me.
J.D.
We'll talk later.
DR. COX
Carla, a personal question. Do you spray
your perfume on or do you keep a tub full
of the crap and slosh around in it?
CARLA
(unfazed)
I smell nice.
J.D. is STRUGGLING WITH THE I.V.
J. D (V. 0.)
C'mon, you've done this to cadavers before.
So this guy's alive, just poke it through
his skin, poke it through - Now!
J.D. makes a move, but CAN'T DO IT. Dr. Cox notices.
DR. COX
Time's up. Do that for him, please. I'm
also gonna need to get an ABG.
J.D.
Why are you telling her?
DR. COX
Shut up and watch.
CARLA
Awwww, be nice to Bambi.
(CONTINUED).•
SCRUBS PINK SA
DR. COX
This gomer has got to stop trying to die
while I'm eating lunch.SCRUBS PINK 9
J.D.
(under his breath)
That's a little insensitive.
Dr. Cox looks up.
J .D (V .0.)
Mistake.
DR. COX
This man is ninety-two, and has full
dementia. He doesn't even know we're
here. For Christ sake, he's inches away
from Carla's rack and he hasn't even
flinched.
CARLA
(sincerely)
That's so sweet.
J.D.
What about his subconscious?
DR. COX
(into patient's ear)
Eisenhower was a sissy.
Dr. Cox waits in a fighting stance for a beat.
DR. COX (CONT'D)
By the grace of God, I think we're gonna
be okay.
(then, to J.D.)
From now on, when I'm in the room, you're
not allowed to talk.
As J.D. gives him the thumbs up and DR. COX EXITS:
CUT TO:
·19 INT. I.C.U. MAIN PATIENT'S ROOM -- MORNING, DAY 2 19
Dr. Kelso moves from patient to patient conducting rounds.
DR. KELSO
Now, Mr. Dorian, can you tell me what
ailment ...
J.D (V.O.)
I'm gonna love rounds. The constant
questions, it's like being on a gameshow.
J.D. clicks his pen as if it were a Jeopardy buzzer, then:
J.D.
What is uremia?
DR. KELSO
That's my boy.SCRUBS PINK 10
J.D.
Uremia may lead to a symmetric sensorimotor
polyneuropathy that tends to affect the
lower limbs more than upper limbs, and is
more marked aistally than proximally ...
DR. KELSO
Whoa, sport. Who stuck a quarter in you?
{then re. patient)
Nice, clean job with the foley catheter.
J .D (V. O.)
I had a nurse do it.
J.D.
Thank you, sir.
J .D (V .0.)
Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch
anybody.
ELLIOT ENTERS. Her hair is up, glasses are on, and she is
obviously frazzled. As she tries to SNEAK IN:
J.D (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I'd been thinking a lot about Elliot.
She's an anal-retentive, crazy,
smartypants, but in kind of a sexy way,
you know?
DR. KELSO
(without turning)
Dr. Reid, you're late.
ELLIOT
I got puked on, and seeing as it was
already the fifth time today, I needed to
cry for a few minutes.
DR. KELSO
Nothing wrong with s91:irting out a few.
You're off the hook if you can tell me
what to look out for in a uremic patient.
Elliot is silent, clueless.
J. D (V. 0.)
Anyway, I decided to go for it.
J.D.
_ {whispers)
Infection.
ELLIOT
Infection?
DR. KELSO
That's my girl. Moving on ...
As they move to the next bed Elliot and J.D. hang back.SCRUBS 11
ELLIOT
I knew the answer.
J.D.
I'm sure you did.
ELLIOT
I was just frazzled--
J.D.
How could you not be?
ELLIOT
You know, with the--
J.D.
I know.
ELLIOT
Good. But thanks, if I can ever do
anything for you--
J.D.
You could let your hair down again.
ELLIOT
(looks at him, then)
Can I wash the puke out first?
J.D.
If you want.
ELLIOT
(smiles, then all
business)
We'll see.
CUT TO:
20 INT. PENTHOUSE -- DAY 20
J.D. daydreaming. He looks at the TV and sees HIMSELF AND
ELLIOT ON THE SCREEN. We GO INTO the TV~
21 INT. SITCOM LIVING ROOM~- CONTINUOUS 21
J.D. sits next to Elliot. They are being questioned by a
six-year-old boy. There is a laugh track.
BOY
Daddy, why did you marry Mommy?
J.D.
Well Tiger, I gave her an answer during
rounds and she immediately had sex with
me.SCRUBS PINK 12
ELLIOT
(with sitcom smile)
Now go do your homework so I can continue
to satisfy your father sexually while
never questioning his authority.
As the boy exits, Elliot straddles J.D. and starts kissing
him. DR. COX ENTERS the fantasy in medical scrubs, pushing
an old woman in a wheelchair.
DR. COX
What the hell are you doing?
22 INT. PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 22
BACK TO REALITY. J.D. turns to see Dr. Cox pushing an older
woman in a wheelchair. He pushes her to the side.
DR. COX
Did you actually page me to ask how much
tylenol to give Mrs. Lenzer? *
J.D.
I was worried that it could exacerbate
the patient's ...
DR. COX
It's regular strength tylenol! Have her
open her mouth, throw a handful at her,
and whatever lands in there is the correct
dosage.
J.D.
But--
DR. COX
And by no means are you to compromise our
no talking agreement.
Dr. Cox sits, works on a chart.
J.D.
Dr. Cox, if you could give me any advice--
DR. COX
Try not to kill anyone.
J.D.
Uh-huh. Dr. Kelso tells us all to stay
positive.
DR. COX
Look, I'm going to be careful because I
don't want to overstate this: Dr. Kelso
is the most evil human being on the face
of the earth and may actually be the devil
himself.
J.D.
Super.SCRUBS BLUE 13
J . D . ( CONT D)
I
It's just that this isn't -what I expected.
Labs and tests and charts - it's all scut
work. Plus most of my patients are ...
(re. old woman, sotto)
Older and kind of checked out mentally ...
DR. COX
· Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.
Bureaucratic nightmares, paperwork out
the ass, and advances that keep people
alive who should have died years ago,
back when they lost what made them people.
Your job is to stay sane enough so that
when someone comes in that you actually
can help, you're not too braindead to·
function, what!?!
J.D.
Do you think we should talk about this in
front of--
DR. COX
Her? She's dead. Write this down, Newbie.
You push around a stiff, nobody asks you
to do anything.
J.D.
Thanks, you've been like a father to me.
DR. COX
Fine, you want some real advice? They
find out that you're making nurses do all
your procedures they'll throw you out on
your ass so quick it'll make you dizzy.
J .D (V .O.)
And there it is.
DR. COX
Have a terrific day.
DR. COX EXITS and J.D. stares into the old woman's lifeless
face, then:
OLD WOMAN
Stop staring at me.
23 INT. I.C.U. NURSES STATION -- LATER 23
Carla hands J.D. one chart after another.SCRUBS PINK 14
CARLA
Okay Bambi, here's Mrs. Lenzer's tox
screen, Mr. Hebert's blood work ...
J .D (V .0.)
I couldn't help wondering if Turk is having
the same experience I am.
TURK
I'm such a stud.
J .D (V .0.)
Probably not.
TURK
This morning, I had my hands inside a
guy's chest. All the way inside; I
couldn't even see them ... I shouldn't be
allowed to do that.
J.D.
And you weren't scared?
TURK
Whatis there to be scared of? You know
what the attending said: "One way or
another, everyone stops bleeding". That's
deep man.
CARLA
No it's not.
TURK
It's a little deep.
Carla rolls HER EYES. Turk watches her EXIT. *
J.D.
So, hey, we never finished before. I
have to tell you about our apartment-
Another surgical intern, TODD QUINLAN, crosses by, HIGH FIVES
TURK.
TODD
T-manl
TURK
J .D., Todd.
J.D.
Hey, how're you do--
J.D. raises his hand in a slight wave and TODD HIGH FIVES
THE HELL out of it. J.D. reacts, in pain.
TODD
(to Turk)
Can I talk to you?
They talk as J.D. stands against the wall.SCRUBS 15
J.D (V.O.)
And like that, I was back in high school.
You see, surgical interns, they're all
slice 'em and dice 'em. They're the jocks.
Medical interns - we're trained to think
about the body. Diagnose, test, keep
.everything on a little notecard. The
medical interns, well ...
TODD
(points)
You've got a stain.
When J.D. looks down, Todd drags his finger up to J.D. •s
face ('made you look').
J .D (V. O.)
We're the chess club.
As Turk waves and he and Todd quickly HEAD OFF:
CUT TO:
24 INT. ER/ADMISSIONS-- MORNING, DAY 3 24
J.D. stands next to a JANITOR, who works on the sliding·glass
door. After an awkward beat:
J.D.
I'm waiting for someone.
JANITOR
Door's broke. Every fifth time or so it
don't open.
J.D.
Maybe there's a penny stuck in there.
JANITOR
Why a penny?
J.D.
I don ' t know ...
JANITOR
Did you stick a penny in there?
J.D.
I was just making small talk.
JANITOR
If I find a penny, I'm taking you down.
ELLIOT ENTERS talking. THEY WALK to rounds.
ELLIOT
Oh my God being on call sucks. You're
all alone, all night - it's terrifying,
you know?SCRUBS BLUE 16
J.D.
The janitor wants to kill me.
ELLIOT
Anyway, about eleven hours into being on
call last night, my twentieth admission
was this young girl who was throwing up
blood, and ... I actually wished it was
me.
.J .D.
You know, I'll bet he 1s killed before.
ELLIOT
Seriously, I'd gladly be that sick to lie
in bed, watch TV, ~et to eat hospital
pudding, right? Right?
J.D.
(regains focus)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, blood for pudding. You.
know, we're both off Monday night, so.
maybe., you know, if you' re not busy, I
don't know, maybe we could--
ELLIOT
I like Italian food, the movie we•re seeing
starts at 9, so we.' 11 eat at 7: 30, and

CUT TO:
30 INT. FOUR BED PATIENT'S ROOM -- DAY 30
A patient, MS. PRATT, reads the newspaper and listens to a
walkman in bed.
J.D (V.O.)
The only way to bounce back is to stay
positive.
J.D.
(cheery)
Ms. Pratt, I'm here to remove some of
that fluid from rour belly, relieve a
little of· that tightness.
MS. PRATI'
Shut up and do it.
J.D.
Fantastic.
(then)
Ma'am, I'm going to need you to roll over
for just a second.
Ms. Pratt begrudgingly does so. As soon as she's turned,
J.D. pulls out his Intern Manual, starts reading. *
TURK {O.S.)
Nice.
(CONTINUED). SCRUBS BLUE 17A
J.D. turns to see Turk, signals him to be quiet. He finishes
looking up the procedure, then hides the book.SCRUBS PINK 18
J.D.
You can roll back, ma'am. Now this'll
just take a second ...
She goes back to her paper. J.D. starts to put the needle
in her stomach, hesitates, afraid.
J. D (V. 0.}
C'mon. Not in front of Turk. Just jam
the razor sharp needle into her gut.
Then, chickening out, to Turk:
J.D.
I think this needle is too big. I'm gonna
get a nurse.
TURK
Learn by doing, man. Learn by doing.
Turk takes the needle and pushes it into her stomach.
J .D (V .0.)
I hated him at that moment. For being
able to do that, for being happy ...
Turk removes the needle. A stream of fluid, though, SQUIRTS
OUT of her belly, like a water-balloon with a pinprick. As *
J.D. presses gauze on the spot: *
TURK
Maybe it was too big a needle.
J.D.
You think? How do I seal this up?
TURK
You want my gum?
MS. PRATT
(puts down paper)
What's going on down there?
TURK
(trying not to laugh)
This is totally normal, ma'am. Just have
to put some pressure ·. on it.
She goes back to reading.
J.D.
So, you going to move your stuff in
tonight?
TURK
That's why I came by. I just feel like
we've done that already, you know?SCRUBS 19
TURK (CONT'D)
It might be good for us to branch out a
little ... What do you think?
J .D (V .O.)
Tell him you miss him. Tell him you need
him to look into your eyes and say that
everything1s going to be fine just like
he-did when the cop pulled you over.
Tell him.
J.D.
Yeah, I feel the same way.
Turk nods, EXITS. J.D. takes a peak under the gauze - it
squirts out again. He sighs.

J.D. and MR. BORSKI, mid-sixties, talk.
MR. BURSKI
I just have bad gas. What're you testing
me for?
J.D.
We need to know if your gas could be
harmful to others.
As the other passengers react, they exit.

J.D.
Look, Mr. Burski, I heard a systolic murmur
in your heart, which is most likely
nothing, but if you don't let me check it
out I'm gonna worry about you all day.
MR. BURSKI
Seriously?
J.D.
(sincere)
Yeah, it would drive me crazy.
MR. BURSKI
Then I'll do it. For you.
(then, moving)
So what's it like being a young hotshot
doctor?
J.D.
Did you ever go to see a movie that
everyone told you was great, then because
of all those expectations, you ended up
totally disappointed?SCRUBS 20
MR. BURSKI
Movies nowadays have too many special
effects.
J.D.
Yeah, that was pretty much my point.
MR. BURSKI
Kid, you want to know my philosophy·of
life? It might help.
J.D.
Lay it on me, Mr. Burski.
MR. BURSKI
The hell with everything.
J.D.
I like that.
J.D. 1S BEEPER GOES OFF. He hands the wheelchair to an
orderly, sprints purposefully down the hall.
J. D (V .0.)
My first code. See, here's how it works.
Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone,
the first doctor in has to run the room,
tell everyone what to do, basically decide
if the patient lives or dies ...

What, am I crazy?
J.D. ducks into a closet, HIDING.

TURK

Turk SHOCKS THE PATIENT, who SITS UP SCREAMING. Everyone

J.D.

Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep
with me you would've done the same thing.
J.D.
I didn't want to sleep with you.
ELLIOT
Uh-huh. And Turk's getting married?
J.D.
Yes, he is ... eventually. I'll tell you
one thing. There's nothing in the world
that would make me sleep with you now.
ELLIOT

Do me right here.
J.D.
Okay.
ELLIOT
See?
J.D.
Damn.
AS J.D. REACTS FRUSTRATED, The DOOR OPENS. It's Dr. Cox.
DR. COX
Right. Hand me a trach kit, please? *
J.D. does so and Dr. Cox closes the door.

J.D. sits on the floor, leans against the door of the on

J. D (V. O.)
I was sitting on the floor for two reasons.
One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply
closet and she kicked me. Hard. And
two, the on-call room was locked.
J.D.
C'mon, I've got like ten minutes to sleep.
36 INT. ON-CALL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 36

Carla is there. An orderly pushes Mr. Burski down the hall.
J.D. ENTERS, checks out Mr. Burski's flowery gown.
J.D.
You look adorable.
MR. BURSKI
Ah, the hell with everything.
J.D.
Hey, I got your test results. You're
gonna be fine. One more night and you're

Mr. Burski covers J.D.'s hand with his.
MR. BURSKI
Thank you. Thank you so much.
J.D. *
No problem. *
J.D. enjoys the moment, then SIGNS THE ORDERLY'S CHART.

ELLIOT
I just hate it. I hate the "darlin's", I
hate the "sweethearts" ...
CARLA
You don't need to tell me how hard it is
being a woman around here.
Bored, Mr. Burski sighs and WHEELS OUT OF FRAME.
ELLIOT
Well, you're certainly furthering the
cause by wearing a thong to work and
hooking up in the on-call room.
Excited, Mr. Burski WHEELS BACK INTO FRAME.
ELLIOT (CONT'D} .
·Word gets around.
CARLA
(slow build)
You talk like that, do you even know my
name? I'm 34, I spend every second of my
life either here, or taking care of my
mom, so yeah, maybe I needed a little
closeness. I'm sure you never had a
quickie at the club, or snuck some skinny,
flat-butted, college boy up to your
sorority room, and you judge me? And my
thong - I like to think it makes my ass
look good, and some days I need to feel
good about something around here, and you
judge me? Well, guess what. Word does
get around, Ms. 11Out for herself", so you
can dump on everyone here if you want,

I couldn't get any sleep 'cause Turk
practically had sex in the on-call room.
DR. COX
You are aware that I have no idea who
Turk is, but good for him. •cause Billy,
sex is life-affirming. Now, how bout you
give me a urine sample, captain.
BILLY
But I just did five minutes ago.
DR. COX
Tell you what. This time put the cup on

Billy exits excitedly to the bathroom.
J.D.

Stop doing that.
DR. COX
Look, worst case scenario, you kill someone
and it hangs over your head your whole
life, but that's absolute worst case.
(off J.D.'s reaction)
Jeez, Newbie, just use the nurses for all
