SOME KIND OF CRAMPED OFFICE - MORNING A 31-year-old woman, MIRA, in smudged makeup and a crumpled cocktail dress, sits in a chair. She speaks to someone off camera who we cannot see. MIRA You have an idea of how your life is going to work out. When I was a kid, all I did was watch romantic comedies in our living room while I did my homework. INT. LIVING ROOM OF A INDIAN-AMERICAN FAMILY\'92S HOUSE - 1988 A 7-year-old Mira does flashcards while she watches the Meg Ryan diner scene in When Harry Met Sally. An old INDIAN GRANDMOTHER sleeps in a chair nearby. SEVEN-YEAR-OLD MIRA I\'92ll have what she\'92s having. INT. SAME LIVING ROOM AS BEFORE - 1995 A 16-year-old Mira studies with piles of textbooks. She\'92s now watching Four Weddings and a Funeral. HUGH GRANT Would you be interested in, perhaps, spending the rest of your life not married to me? ANDIE MCDOWELL I do. MIRA I do. MIRA (V.O.) In college I had less time to watch movies... EXT. DORM BUILDING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - 2002 We pan up the side of a brick dorm at Princeton University, seeing young couples hooking up in different rooms. We land on the window of a now 20-year-old Mira, sitting on her dorm room bed, with piles of biology textbooks in front of her, studying. She\'92s also watching You\'92ve Got Mail. MEG RYAN I wanted it to be you. MIRA I wanted it to be you. Mira\'92s roommate and best friend GWEN, walks into the room and tosses her a box of Pop Tarts which Mira catches without looking. GWEN Have you showered this week? Mira shakes her head solemnly, transfixed by the movie. MIRA (V.O.) And then, eventually, I had no time at all. INT. MANHATTAN HOSPITAL - NIGHT - 2010 Mira, now 30, an intern at a hospital, in a doctors coat and scrubs, stands with a group of other eager student-doctors. MIRA (V.O.) But romantic comedies had done their damage. One is JEREMY REED, 30, super hot and pretty, and total bad news in a Bradley Cooper kind of way. Another is CLAYTON BROOKS, 30, not too shabby-looking himself, but serious and disdainful. To be honest, he\'92s kind of a dick. These are our guys. There are few others, led by a distinguished doctor, MARC SHULMAN, who has a yarmulke and a Brooklyn accent. He talks to a PREGNANT PATIENT and her HUSBAND. DR. SHULMAN You\'92re eight and a half months pregnant, your husband\'92s gotta keep his schvantz away from you. JEREMY Which I can imagine is hard with a wife as beautiful as yours. The patient enjoys this. Brooks rolls his eyes. Jeremy smiles at them, and then glances at Mira and winks at her. Mira reacts: holy shit, did that happen? DR. SHULMAN She\'92s already pregnant, Dr. Reed. (to the couple) I\'92m putting Dr. Brooks in charge of you. He\'92s my best student. The students grumble while Brooks steps forward with an imperious smile. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 2. BROOKS (intense) Clayton Brooks. I am determined to give you and your unborn baby the most focused and unwavering care. Now it\'92s Jeremy\'92s turn to roll his eyes. MIRA (V.O.) That\'92s when I saw him. We move past Brooks to outside of the room, where we see a MOST APPEALING GUY, a doctor, reading a newspaper. This guy looks like he walked out of a Nora Ephron movie. Floppy hair, dimples, the works. MIRA (to herself) Hello. INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER Mira is in the elevator. The doors begin to close when-- MOST APPEALING GUY Hold the door! It\'92s the guy. He walks into the elevator. MIRA It\'92s you. MOST APPEALING GUY What? MIRA Achoo. Just a cute little sneeze. What floor? MOST APPEALING GUY Same as yours. He smiles warmly at her, then accidentally drops his thermos and newspaper. Mira gets down to help him and her folders slip out of her hands. They start picking up all their stuff. TOM Klutzes? Party of two. Mira\'92s hair - tied up in a bun - comes undone. She can\'92t believe it. MIRA (V.O.) An elevator? Our stuff fell out of our hands? My hair came undone? Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 3. (MORE) Holy crap, I\'92m basically Sandra Bullock. But then it happened. The omen. Er, omen sounds bad. What\'92s a good omen called? Oh, whatever. The elevator jerks to a stop and the lights flicker. MOST APPEALING GUY Did the elevator just stop? Mira closes her eyes. It all led up to this. It\'92s happening. MIRA I\'92m Mira. Obstetrics and gynecology. MOST APPEALING GUY Tom. Orthodonist. They shake hands, both somehow aware of what all this means. MIRA (V.O.) We were stuck in the elevator twenty minutes and I moved into his apartment two months later. VOICE (V.O.) (thick Caribbean accent) Ma\'92am. What does dis have to do with you stealing ja bike, driving ja bike while intoxicated, then trespassing in ja swimming pool? INT. POLICE PRECINCT - PRESENT DAY A un-smiling FEMALE POLICE OFFICER sits across from Mira in a precinct room. We see Mira has been telling her story here. MIRA Tom got married last night. To someone else. Some Serbian girl who sells bagels in the lobby of the hospital. INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MORNING We see a beautiful SERBIAN GIRL handing Tom a bagel and coffee in the lobby of the hospital. SERBIAN GIRL One tall latte vith extra cream no sugar. She smiles. She has horrible teeth. Tom smiles back, enchanted. Off her teeth we dissolve to: Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 4. MIRA (V.O.) (CONT'D) EXT. WEDDING TENT - NIGHT We now see Serbian girl smiling under a tent at a posh postwedding dinner reception. She smiles. Perfect teeth. MIRA (V.O.) He dumped me, she moved in, he fixed her teeth. They got married last night. I don\'92t think they thought I would actually go, so they invited me. But I did go. We now see Mira, in her dress, sitting at a table with various old people and foreigners. MIRA (V.O.) I was at the worst table - the Randoms. You know, where the old babysitters and childhood pen pals sit? Mira and an OLD HIPPIE LADY get wasted and are laughing loudly. MIRA (V.O.) So, me and Tom\'92s old babysitter Bernice got wasted together. BERNICE Why would Tom break up with a thoughtful girl like you? MIRA He wanted kids. BERNICE You don\'92t want kids? MIRA No, he wanted kids. Six of \'91em. He thought I was too old for that. BERNICE Six kids? What is he, in a cult? (confiding) He wet the bed until he was 10. MIRA (V.O.) And then, I felt like making a speech. Mira is now at the microphone. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 5. MIRA Some of you may know Tom and I used to date. So I have some pretty good stories of everyone\'92s favorite glorified dentist. People laugh with anticipation, including Tom and the bride. We see Clayton, Dr. Shulman and his wife, and Jeremy are there. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Like the time he thought he had Lyme disease but it turned out to be a patch of dry skin on his stomach. People laugh. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Or how he always says \'93Oh, Larry\'94 when we watch Curb Your Enthusiasm, like he has a personal relationship with Larry David. People love this. Brooks whispers to Dr. Shulman. BROOKS What\'92s Curb Your Enthusiasm? DR. SHULMAN Oy vey. MIRA Or the time he told me during sex that he wanted to marry me and make me pregnant with six babies. People stop smiling. Brooks covers his eyes. Jeremy loves this. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Which I really wanted too. But, well, that didn\'92t end up happening. Obviously. Cuz here I am, sitting with a bunch of randoms at his wedding to the Serbian bagel girl. (whispering) By the way, are we a hundred percent sure she\'92s not a war criminal? (then, off their reaction) Oh, get over yourselves. Like the thought didn\'92t cross your mind. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 6. (MORE) So: to Tom and Bagel Girl. May you never run out of bagels. Mira throws her wine glass down, shattering it. MIRA (CONT\'92D) L\'92Chaim! Peace. I\'92m out. Tom wet the bed until he was ten! (Mr. T.) Huhn! Mira leaves the stage, grabs a bottle of champagne from a waiter\'92s tray, walks out of the tent past the caterers, grabs a bike, and begins to pedal and drink at the same time. She bikes off. EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mira is biking, wasted, and drinking in a residential area. MIRA I\'92m Kate Hudson. I\'92m Kate Hudson. She runs a red light, and narrowly misses a car. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Racist! Mira careens into the driveway of a house. She looks at it. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Tudor. Nice. She speeds through the driveway and does not notice the bike is riding straight toward a swimming pool. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Oh shi-- She can\'92t stop and falls into the pool. Underwater, Mira opens her eyes. She notices a Minnie Mouse toy at the bottom of the pool. It is frowning at her. MINNIE MOUSE (with contempt) Loser. Thirty-one year old loser. MIRA (subtitled) Who the hell do you think you are, you little bitch? MINNIE MOUSE At least I have a boyfriend. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 7. MIRA (CONT\'92D) MIRA (V.O.) And when Minnie Mouse pointed out that even she had a long-term boyfriend, I just started to cry. Mira is now crying underwater somehow. It\'92s pitiful. MIRA (V.O.) This is not where I thought I\'92d be. END COLD OPEN Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 8. ACT ONE INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS Mira continues to be questioned at the police station. MIRA I got fished out by the people who own the house, who were actually not that nice. They called you and here I am. OFFICER #2 We have you down for two counts of public intoxication, theft, and disorderly conduct. MIRA I\'92m getting the third degree because of freaking disorderly conduct? Aren\'92t there rapists and murderers out there? CARIBBEAN OFFICER #1 When you\'92re disorderly you\'92re a rapist of peace and quiet. MIRA Okay, look. (demure) Did I mention that I\'92m a doctor? An OBGYN? I bring life into this world. CARIBBEAN OFFICER #1 So what? MIRA * Do you guys need free birth control? They consider this. Another officer enters. OFFICER #3 She\'92s been bailed out. OFFICER #2 We\'92re not even finished questioning her. OFFICER #3 She\'92s being bailed out by the governor\'92s daughter. Mira smiles. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 9. MIRA It\'92s been great working with you guys and seeing this process from * the inside. INT. POLICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Gwen is there. Gwen is now an impeccably-dressed beauty, rocking motherhood Gwyneth Paltrow-style. Mira hugs her. MIRA I love you so much. GWEN I don\'92t love you at all. * MIRA * I have enough love for the both of * us, you political royalty, you. * GWEN * I can\'92t keep using my mom for this * stuff. I\'92m already using her to get * Sophie into private school. Get in * the car, I\'92m late to drop Sophie off to hip-hop and get filler injected in my nasolabial folds. Mira stops Gwen. * MIRA Tell me the truth. How bad is it? GWEN It\'92s on Facebook, but it hasn\'92t been re-mixed into a song yet. Gwen hands Mira her phone. Mira watches a recording of her toast. MIRA (O.C.) \'93Are we a hundred percent sure she\'92s not a war criminal?\'94 MIRA (CONT\'92D) Wow. I went to genocide. GWEN You looked pretty, though. MIRA Yeah, my hair\'92s not bad. Who shot this? Why did they leave all this space to the left of me? Know how to center, much? Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 10. GWEN You\'92re right. That\'92s the takeaway. INT. GWEN\'92S MERCEDES SUV - CONTINUOUS SOPHIE, Gwen\'92s 6-year-old daughter, is in the back seat. MIRA I\'92ll never give you crap for being a housewife again. I don\'92t know how to repay you. GWEN I\'92m not a housewife. I\'92m an attorney that has taken an indefinite amount of time off to raise my daughter. Everyone put your seat belts on. SOPHIE Mine was on the whole time. GWEN Good girl. (to Mira) I know how you can repay me. You could hit me up with some wink-wink in my nasolabial folds. MIRA I don\'92t do wink-wink. I do pap smears. You need a plastic surgeon. Gwen pulls out of the parking lot. GWEN I just feel like our relationship isn\'92t reciprocal. MIRA Uh, I protect you from yourself. You\'92d look like Bruce Jenner if it wasn\'92t for me. SOPHIE What\'92s a pap smear? What\'92s winkwink? GWEN Nothing sweetheart. It\'92s adult stuff, like taxes. (then, to Mira) Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 11. (MORE) I want to tell you this, because I am picking you up from a police precinct and I think it\'92s timely. You need to pull it together. * MIRA * I know. * (gesturing to self) * This person? This drunk, crime- * committing person? She\'92s history. * There is no reason for me to live * my life like this. I went to a good * college. I\'92m a successful doctor. * My body mass index could be better * but I\'92m not like, Precious or * anything. This is my year. * (then, empowered) * Do you have a multi-vitamin? I feel * like taking one. * GWEN * You have that date tonight with * Dennis. Carl worked really hard to * sell you at his firm. * MIRA * I am so psyched for this date. A * real date. Not hooking up with a * guy at the end of a party. Not * sleeping with Jeremy because he has * that insane, Biblical-quality hair, * and then the next day I\'92m all: * (cool detached voice) * \'93By the way, what\'92s our deal, * anyway?\'94. * GWEN * You do that? That\'92s horrifying. * SOPHIE * This is boring. * MIRA * You\'92re boring. Contribute * something. * Mira rummages through a small cooler and begins to eat. * SOPHIE That\'92s my lunch! * MIRA You seriously get a bento box for * lunch? * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 12. GWEN (CONT'D) SOPHIE (freaking out) Don\'92t eat it! It\'92s mine! Its mine! * MIRA You\'92re spoiled! I\'92m helping you build character! Mira gets a loud page on her pager. SOPHIE What\'92s that? * MIRA My pager. Oh my god. My patient\'92s in labor. SOPHIE (with disdain) Who has pagers? * MIRA Uh, important people like drug dealers and big shot doctors like me. (to Gwen) We gotta haul ass to St. E\'92s. I have four patients and three don\'92t speak English or have any health insurance. But this one does: Alison Silverman. White. From Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Cha-ching. GWEN Can you go there looking like this? MIRA I work hard, I play hard. GWEN You look like Carrie. MIRA Bradshaw? GWEN Stephen King. MIRA Dammit. Left here! Gwen takes a hard left. Mira\'92s beeper goes off again. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 13. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Why aren\'92t we moving? Gwen, I specifically told you to haul ass. There is bumper to bumper traffic for blocks. MIRA (CONT\'92D) I can\'92t lose this delivery. See you * guys! GWEN Where are you--? Too late. Mira is off. EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MORNING Mira is booking it down the street in her cocktail dress and heels. She stops, yanks off her heels, and continues to run. EXT. ST. ELIZABETH\'92S MEDICAL CENTER - MORNING Mira runs in past people. They stare at her. * MIRA * Excuse me! I\'92m saving a life! Get * out of my way! * INT. ELEVATOR BAY - CONTINUOUS * Mira\'92s in the elevator. The doors are closing. * MIRA * (impatient) * Come on, come on! * The doors are closing when an extremely ancient DIALYSIS * PATIENT sticks his cane in the elevator. He\'92s in wheelchair * and has a bored TEENAGE ATTENDANT listening to headphones. * OLD MAN * Dialysis, please. * MIRA * Sure. * She pushes the button, hiding a sigh. * OLD MAN * I was stationed in India in the * 50\'92s. Beautiful country. * MIRA * So I hear. Never been. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 14. OLD MAN * And such beautiful women. Are you * married? * MIRA * I\'92m sorry, I have to ask, just for * my own feeling of self-worth. Are * you asking because you\'92re thinking * \'93I\'92m a really old man, I might as * well reach for the stars and ask * this girl out?\'94 or because you * think it is plausible, based on our * appearances, that we could be a * viable couple? * OLD MAN * The latter. * MIRA * I am going to kill myself. * The door opens. Mira runs out to Labor & Delivery. * INT. HOSPITAL - LABOR AND DELIVERY Mira runs in, feet dirty, still in her cocktail dress, looking wretched, panting. An O.R. Nurse, MARILYN, sees her. * MIRA * Tell me good news, Marilyn. * MARILYN Her contractions were too close. I * had to call the doctor on call. Mira runs by a delivery room, and sees Brooks handing Mrs. Silverman her baby. Brooks walks out, taking off his gloves * and mask. MIRA (crestfallen) You delivered my patient. BROOKS You\'92re welcome. Brooks looks Mira up and down with disdain. BROOKS (CONT\'92D) What prom did you just give birth * at? * MIRA I was right here. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 15. BROOKS I promise, I tried reasoning with the baby, telling him that the real doctor was sobering up on the floor of a jail cell, but he just didn\'92t seem to care. MIRA You did not go there. * BROOKS It\'92s impossible not to go there. * Also, Mrs. Silverman asked if I * would be her doctor from now on and I said yes. Mira reacts. Brooks ducks into the doctors\'92 lounge. * INT. DOCTORS\'92 LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS MIRA You\'92re stealing my patient? * BROOKS It\'92s not stealing if she wanted to go. (then, surprised and revolted) Jesus! What are you doing? Mira holds a large clump of her hair in her hand. MIRA I\'92m taking out my hair extensions. * God, you are so sheltered. * BROOKS We are not two members of the same * R&B girls group. That is * disturbing. Pull yourself together. * I can see your undergarment. Mira looks down. Her strapless bra is peeking out a good two inches of her dress. She shoves it down, mortified. JEREMY (O.C.) It\'92s called a bra, Brooks. Or, have you never seen one before? Jeremy is lounging on the sofa, reading a magazine. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 16. JEREMY (CONT\'92D) It hooks around a woman\'92s back, and kind of lifts and supports the breasts-- Jeremy mimes a woman\'92s breasts with his hands. JEREMY (CONT\'92D) * --And they\'92re very fun to take off. I recommend it someday. Come here, Mira. Keep me company. Jeremy pats the space next to him on the sofa. Mira sits next to him. Brooks gets an apple from the vending machine. BROOKS What a beautiful picture: the alcoholic and the sex addict. JEREMY (hurt) That is not fair. Yes, I love sex. And I do it a lot. But I\'92m not addicted to it. I\'92m addicted to attention, which manifests itself in frequent sexual encounters. MIRA That\'92s really interesting. BROOKS (disgusted) Oh, God. JEREMY (CONT\'92D) Is it so wrong that I became an OBGYN because woman\'92s sexuality is the thing I love the most in the world? MIRA Not at all. That\'92s noble. BROOKS Yes, of course it is. JEREMY (CONT\'92D) I don\'92t need to explain myself to you. BROOKS But one day you might, to a judge. * Brooks turns to leave. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 17. BROOKS (CONT\'92D) * I also want to add it\'92s extremely * annoying I can\'92t read the newspaper * in here because Dr. Reed has turned * the doctor\'92s lounge into a place of * tawdry sexuality. * He leaves in a huff. Jeremy gets up. * JEREMY * I have no idea what he is talking * about. * Jeremy dims the lights to exactly doing-it level. He comes * back to the sofa. * JEREMY (CONT\'92D) (turned on) You look so trashy right now. Wanna * hang out? * MIRA We are hanging out. * JEREMY * Like hang out, deep? * MIRA * Thanks for the offer, but...I * actually should be heading back to * the office. * Mira hops up. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * See you there? * JEREMY * (slightly shocked) * Sure. Cool. * MIRA * Cool. * Mira leaves, super impressed with herself. * END OF ACT ONE Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 18. ACT TWO INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING * We see the door of a medical office, it says: Shulman Womens * Health Associates: Shulman, Brooks, Reed & Kaviraya, OBGYNs * INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS * There is a central reception area, and four doors around it * with individual doctor\'92s offices. By each office are chairs * and chic, well-dressed patients. Except Mira\'92s. * Mira\'92s area is messy and trying to do too much, kind of like * Mira. It\'92s mismatched chairs, a Bob Marley poster on the * wall, and ethnic tapestries. There are two patients there - * an ancient sleeping lady and a Mexican woman in a poncho knitting. At the central reception desk, a girl, BETSY, built * like a linebacker (female Chris Farley), reads the newspaper and sits next to a delicate looking young man, ERIC (Chris Colfer with no singing ability). These are Shulman Associates * receptionists. Betsy shrieks. ERIC What? What is it? BETSY I\'92m sorry. I thought that raisin was a bug. We see a single stray raisin on the desk between them. She reaches over and pops it in her mouth. Eric is disgusted. BETSY (CONT\'92D) What? I know it\'92s not a bug. ERIC But were you sure it was a raisin? Mira enters, takes a deep breath, and walks up to the main * reception desk. * MIRA Guys, I don\'92t know how else to put * this: I spent the night in jail. * ERIC * Yeah, we saw it on youtube. * BETSY * They did a mash-up of it with Ke$ha * song. It was hilarious. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 19. MIRA * That was fast. Okay, well, I\'92m glad * it happened, in a way. Because now: * fresh start. New me. Guys, it has * come to my attention that my part * of the office looks more like a * marijuana dispensary than a successful doctor\'92s office. Who is * in charge of decorating? ERIC That wasn\'92t a job you really designated to anyone. MIRA I need my section of this office to * not look like Port Authority. * BETSY I\'92m so sorry we let you down, Mira. MIRA Just, let\'92s try to fix this. BETSY And to do this on the day of your * big date? It\'92s unforgivable. Betsy hurls her magazine in anger. * BETSY (CONT\'92D) Betsy, how could you be so stupid?! * MIRA Well, don\'92t get over-upset. BETSY * Stupid! Stupid! * MIRA * Okay. Stop. Stop. I forgive you. * BETSY * You\'92re so merciful. * MIRA Let\'92s change subjects. Tonight. Hot Date. Real date. I am not * available. Even if Taylor Swift herself is delivering triplets. No * interruptions. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 20. BETSY We should definitely talk about this, but you have a new patient and she\'92s waiting in your office. MIRA (excited) Oh hell yes. * Mira goes to enter her office. ERIC May I suggest you put on your lab coat? You look like your own mug shot. MIRA Yikes. Hit me up. Mira throws on her lab coat, Eric and Betsy spruce her up by running a comb through her hair and removing lint - they do this a lot. Mira goes in. INT. MIRA\'92S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER We see NASREEN,a very pregnant woman in a hijab, accompanied by her 10-year-old son, MAX. Mira looks through her chart, disappointed. MIRA So Nasreen, you are eight and a half months pregnant with your second child. Your husband died six months ago and you was covered under his health insurance, leaving you... with no coverage. Max translates. Nasreen says: \'93That is correct.\'94 MIRA (CONT\'92D) I\'92m sorry, we have a policy. Mira points to a sign on the wall with an illustration of Hagar the Horrible saying: \'93No health insurance, no care.\'94 Max translates back. MAX Do you think you could make an exception? MIRA It\'92s just that if I treat you, then others will use this as a precedent. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 21. Max translates. MAX * We won\'92t tell anyone. MIRA Still, they could find out. MAX How? MIRA I might say something. It might slip out by the watercooler. In my sleep. I can\'92t control it. A confused Max begins to translate this. He\'92s miming a water cooler. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Okay, fine. I\'92ll take you on as a patient. But I am really not psyched about this. You need to promise me you\'92ll get insurance. And don\'92t mention this to anyone. Max translates and Nasreen is excited. MAX Thank you so much. MIRA You\'92re welcome. I better be the godmother to this freaking kid. Nasreen, come with me. Max gets up. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Max, you can stay here. MAX What if she needs me? MIRA We\'92ll be fine. (off his worried look) Here, play with my phone. But don\'92t download anything. INT. RECEPTION AREA - A LITTLE LATER Nasreen and Max leave. Mira stands at the door. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 22. MIRA Bye guys! Hope you find the bus stop okay! * They leave. Mira turns to Betsy and Eric. MIRA (CONT\'92D) What the hell, you guys? A nonEnglish-speaking, 8 months pregnant widow with no health insurance?! * BETSY * I couldn\'92t turn her away. MIRA Yes, you could\'92ve. I admire that * you guys want to help the needy, but this office is not an inflatable raft. I give plenty to charity, I\'92m doing a noble profession, and frankly, I have my own problems, okay? I am hooked on expensive hair products the way a heroin addict is hooked on drugs. I just can\'92t take any more patients who can\'92t pay or don\'92t have health insurance. I want patients like * those guys. * Mira gestures to the white patients sitting in the other * doctor\'92s areas. Betsy takes notes on a pad. * BETSY * More white patients. Done. * MIRA * Well, don\'92t write that. * (whispers) * But yes. * (then, to Eric) * Give me my date outfit. I want to * try it on. * Eric hands her a bag of clothes. * ERIC * I resent that you made me buy your * clothes. Just because I\'92m gay * doesn\'92t mean I like shopping for * womens clothes. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 23. INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER * Brooks is now there, picking up some paperwork. Mira steps * out, wearing wedge boots, leggings, an over-sized and a chic * over-sized sweater, chunky necklace. * MIRA * Well? * BETSY * You look amazing. * MIRA * Thanks. I wanted to wear sequins * but Gwen says it looks like I\'92m * going to a quincea\'f1era. * Brooks makes a noise of disapproval. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * I can hear you, making little * sounds. What? * BROOKS * That is not a good date outfit. * MIRA * What do you mean? It\'92s fashion-y * and fabulous. * BROOKS * Bag lady sweater? Those boots that * look live hooves? Chunky necklace? * Girls like that stuff but guys hate * it. * MIRA * Uhh, I\'92m pretty sure guys like * this. * BROOKS * I repeat: Unless your date is with * an middle-aged lesbian, that is not * a good date outfit. * ERIC * (smitten) * That\'92s hilarious. * MIRA * No, it\'92s not hilarious, Eric. It\'92s * offensive. I\'92m offended on behalf * of gay people. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 24. ERIC * I\'92m gay and I loved it. * MIRA * Shut up, Eric. Other, smarter, gay * people. * BROOKS * Just my two cents. But what do I * know? I\'92m just a wealthy, single, * heterosexual white male. * ERIC * (into it) * Yeah, you are. * BETSY * Well, what do you think she should * wear? * BROOKS * Easy. Tight dress. High heels. * MIRA * Great. Clayton Brooks, everyone, * the most boring, predictable man on * the planet. * BROOKS * Okay, fine. You know what would * really look best? If you lost * fifteen pounds. * Mira\'92s mouth drops open. * MIRA * You want to get smacked, son? * A few patients look up, concerned. * BROOKS * (loudly) * No, Dr. Kaviraya, I don\'92t want to * get smacked in my place of work. I * want to peacefully go about my day. * The patients shoot Mira dirty looks. * BROOKS (CONT\'92D) * (whispering) * And maybe invest in a padded bra. * Brooks walks away, triumphant. Mira is speechless. We hear a * beep. It\'92s her phone. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 25. It says: \'93I think you look hot.\'94 She looks up. Jeremy is in * his doorway, smiling at her. She smiles back. * INT. JEREMY\'92S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Mira and Jeremy make out on the floor of his exam room. * MIRA You smell like peaches. JEREMY You smell like chlorine and vomit. MIRA I\'92m so sorry. JEREMY No, it makes it more wrong. I love it. Mira runs her fingers through Jeremy\'92s hair. MIRA God, your hair is so thick. It\'92s like a tar pit. * Jeremy starts to push up her skirt. MIRA (CONT\'92D) No wait. Stop. We can\'92t. I told * myself I wouldn\'92t. * JEREMY * Let\'92s just worry about that later. * MIRA We wouldn\'92t worry about it. Only I would. * Mira dis-entangles herself. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) I should be using my thirties to try to find a real boyfriend. Because someday I\'92d like to have a real husband. And some actual kids. My friends all got married in their 20s when I was becoming a doctor. So I can\'92t spend the next ten years fooling around with colleagues even * if they look like a mannequin that * came to life. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 26. JEREMY * That would make a great blog entry. * I kind of just want to get naked * right now. * MIRA * Look, I can still be your hook-up buddy in my forties, fifties, and sixties. JEREMY I won\'92t want to have sex with you in your forties, fifties, and sixties. MIRA Sorry. I want to, but I can\'92t. * Mira turns to leave. She then impulsively kisses him. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * I think that\'92s a good compromise. * Addicts can\'92t go cold turkey. It * doesn\'92t work. * She kisses him again. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * Okay, that was too much. * Mira leaves. Jeremy is a little impressed at her restraint. * INT. HALLWAY - LATER * Mira walks, now on the phone. She\'92s in tight dress and high * heels and her coat, on her way out. * GWEN (O.C.) You\'92re lying. * MIRA I didn\'92t! Mostly because I\'92m * wearing Spanx. But no, I didn\'92t. * GWEN (O.C.) That\'92s my girl. He\'92s ridiculous * looking, though. I don\'92t think I * would\'92ve been able to stop. (to someone off-camera) Sophie don\'92t use that kid\'92s inhaler. You don\'92t have asthma. * (then, to Mira) * You\'92re not wearing sequins, right? * Sequins are for earnest sluts. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 27. MIRA * I disagree with that, but no, I\'92m * not. * (quietly) * Tight dress, high heels. * GWEN * That\'92s perfect, Mir! * Mira hits the elevator button. MIRA I think it\'92s lateral, but whatever. * I\'92m so excited to meet Dennis. Eric * printed out a picture of him from * Facebook. It\'92s super tiny because * all Eric\'92s friends are gay tweakers * and have no degrees of friends * close to him. But he looks good. * Mira squints at a print out of a tiny pixillated picture. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * I think I love Dennis. Is that possible? GWEN No. That\'92s weird. You have not met or spoken to him. MIRA It seriously feels like love though. GWEN (O.C.) Mira, I didn\'92t want to tell you this to freak you out, but Dennis is an analyst... for Beyonce Knowles. The elevator opens. MIRA You think you have to use her last name?! Oh. My. God. (to the people in the elevator) Go. Go! I\'92m obviously not getting on. END OF ACT TWO Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 28. ACT THREE EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT TIME Mira sits inside the backseat of a running cab. She is * praying aloud. * MIRA * Dear Lord, please let this date be * good. May he have the wealth of Mayor Bloomberg. The personality of * Jon Stewart. The face of Michael * Fassbender. * (beat, sure, why not?) * The penis of Michael Fassbender. The cab driver clicks the meter back on, impatiently. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * I\'92m going, I\'92m going. * INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER Mira enters the restaurant, tentatively. She approaches a hostess. MIRA Hi. I\'92m here to meet a man I\'92ve never met before on a blind date. He\'92s in finance, so I\'92m assuming he\'92s in a suit. Probably a fancy one. He\'92s Caucasian. HOSTESS (annoyed) Does this Caucasian man have a first or last name? MIRA Oh! Yes. Dennis. The hostess gestures to a HANDSOME GUY IN A CORNER BOOTH. MIRA (CONT\'92D) (psyched, to herself) Whoa. Dennis. Way to look. * INT. RESTAURANT - SOON AFTER Mira sits with Dennis at a table. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 29. MIRA Hi. I\'92m Mira. Sorry I\'92m late. Just came from a delivery. Threw this on and raced over. DENNIS You look very pretty for having * raced over. MIRA That is so sweet. But yeah, like I said, I\'92m so not prepared in any * way for this date. Or is it even a date? I don\'92t care - I just like to meet interesting people. DENNIS * It\'92s a date. * Mira opens the menu, happily. * MIRA What should I get? I\'92m basically a vegetarian. I eat chicken and fish and hamburgers. Never steak. INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER MIRA Wall Street, huh? So you guys must have access to a lot of drugs. That must be cool. Dennis laughs. DENNIS I don\'92t have access to drugs, actually. Do you? MIRA No, I hate drugs. I don\'92t even know how to do them. I didn\'92t know pot and marijuana were the same thing until college. We see Mira discreetly cross off \'93Drugs\'94 with a golf pencil on a small list that is sitting on her lap. Her beeper goes off. She silences it. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Sorry about that. (then) Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 30. (MORE) But the stress of your job, finance * is an emotional rollercoaster, I bet. Good thing there\'92s so many therapists in the city. DENNIS I wouldn\'92t know. I go running when I\'92m stressed. Mira smiles, crosses off \'93Depression\'94 on her list. MIRA Me too. Well, slow jogging. And I mean slow. Like elderly people have passed me, before. DENNIS That sounds really cute, actually. * Dennis places his hand on Mira\'92s. * DENNIS (CONT\'92D) * Carl said you were kind of crazy * and dramatic. But you\'92re not that * way at all. * Mira smiles. YES. YES. SEE? I CAN CHANGE! * MIRA I hate drama. I\'92m like Mary J. * Blige. * Mira\'92s phone starts vibrating. DENNIS Boy, you\'92re blowing up. MIRA It\'92s stupid. I hate it. Mira takes the battery out of her phone and drops it in her water. MIRA (CONT\'92D) Battery destroyed. My calm, adult * self is all yours. * DENNIS I love it. MIRA (then, glancing at card) Say, what are your feelings on...um...huh. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 31. MIRA (CONT\'92D) She glances at her card. It says: \'93Married\'94 * MIRA (CONT\'92D) How do I put this...umm, are you * married? DENNIS What? No. Why would I be on a date with you if I was married? MIRA (psyched) Yeah, you\'92re right. My question made no sense. I think maybe I\'92m a little tipsy, because I barely ate, because my appetite is so small. The hostess comes over: * HOSTESS Miss? You have an emergency phone call. DENNIS If you need to take it, go. MIRA One second, please. And please don\'92t disappear or go anywhere or I won\'92t be sure I didn\'92t dream this entire date. Dennis smiles warmly. INT. BY THE WOMEN\'92S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mira\'92s on the phone, very angry. MIRA Are you seriously calling me on my date? How did you even know I was here? MAX (O.S.) The large woman at your office told me. MIRA I\'92m going to kill Betsy. Are you happy now, Max? You are responsible for that large woman\'92s imminent termination. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 32. MAX (O.S.) I\'92m really scared, Dr. Mira. Please come see my mom. MIRA I\'92m on a date, Max. Do you even understand the difficulty of a chubby 31-year-old woman going on a legit date with a professional white male who is not bald? MAX (O.S.) Huh? MIRA Fine. Fine. Dammit. INT. RESTAURANT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER Mira stands by a bewildered Dennis, holding her coat. DENNIS * You\'92re leaving? Can\'92t someone else * cover for you? MIRA Technically yes, but I really need to go. He looks puzzled. MIRA (CONT\'92D) I don\'92t have many patients. But the ones I do have chose me when they have literally dozens of other better options in my own building. So if they\'92re willing to take that chance on me, I feel like the least I can do is be there when they\'92re * having a baby. DENNIS So, I\'92ll just finish dinner by myself. MIRA I had a great time. You\'92re * incredibly cute, and from what I * can tell, you have no * imperfections. I\'92m sorry I\'92m not * able to stay. I hope we can go out again sometime. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 33. DENNIS (no way) Sure. I\'92ll call you. MIRA (sad, goodbye) * Looking forward to it. Mira exits. She kicks the wall on the way out. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! * EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mira runs out in her cocktail dress. MIRA Taxi! There are no taxis. MIRA (CONT\'92D) * Dammit! * EXT. STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Mira books it down the street. She stops and takes off her heels, sprinting. MIRA * Dammit! * EXT. ST. ELIZABETH\'92S MEDICAL CENTER - CONTINUOUS Mira races in. She slides into the elevator. She hits her * shoes against the wall, annoyed. * INT. LABOR & DELIVERY - CONTINUOUS Mira bursts in. MIRA Marilyn! Prep the patient. I\'92m scrubbin\'92 in! INT. HOSPITAL - DOCTORS\'92 LOCKER ROOM Mira hurls her purse on the floor and opens her locker. Close- * up as she presses play on the iPod dock. We hear Beyonce\'92s * \'93Countdown\'94 play. Listening to this song, she closes her eyes * for a moment, centering herself. She opens her eyes with a * new-found focus. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 34. We now see why Mira is our hero: alone in the doctors\'92 locker room, she has a confidence and energy we have not seen before. To the beat of this awesome song, Mira looks in the * mirror. She is ready and psyched. She takes off her earrings, puts her hair in a bun, takes out her contacts, puts on her glasses, washes her hands, and gets ready for the delivery. She is all business. She\'92s calm, confident. We see her walk in slow-mo out of the doctors\'92 locker room in her scrubs to the operating room like Danny Ocean. Who wouldn\'92t want this woman to be her doctor? INT. HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM - A LITTLE LATER Nasreen and Max are there. They look terrified. MIRA Max, your baby sister is upside down, so I need to do an emergency c-section on your mom. Will you tell her? Max translates. MIRA (CONT\'92D) To do that, we\'92re going to have to put you under. Max translates. Nasreen nods. * MAX I don\'92t want to leave her. MIRA It\'92s going to be okay. I do these all the time, and I know what I\'92m doing. Max translates. Nasreen nods. MIRA (CONT\'92D) (to Max) Hey. You\'92re going to be okay, too. I promise. Sit right outside. Take my phone. Mira gestures to the phone. Max takes it and leaves. EXT. OPERATING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER Mira is operating. We see Brooks watching from the window of the operation room. Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 35. INT. RECOVERY ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER Nasreen holds her baby girl with Max next to her. They look * to Mira gratefully. Mira smiles back, going over details of * the surgery. * INT. HOSPITAL - DOCTORS\'92 LOUNGE - AN HOUR LATER * Mira sits in the doctors\'92 lounge playing Connect Four by herself on a table. On the TV we see When Harry Met Sally is * playing. Billy Crystal is running through the Manhattan * streets. * BILLY CRYSTAL (V.O.) * ...When you realize you want to * spend the rest of your life with * somebody, you want the rest of your * life to start as soon as possible. * Mira watches, a little sad. Brooks stands watching it in the * doorway. * BROOKS * Who would actually do that? You * don\'92t need to run. You can just see * her the next day. * MIRA * What? Who wouldn\'92t run? * They look at each other. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * How are we the same species? * Brooks sits down at the same table. * BROOKS * I\'92m assuming, date is cancelled? * Mira nods, a little miserable. * BROOKS (CONT\'92D) * Who was the guy? MIRA An analyst. BROOKS What did he analyze? Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 36. MIRA I don\'92t know. Stocks or something? Files? But he made a lot of money * and he wasn\'92t clinically depressed. BROOKS Whoa. Book a church. * MIRA * Maybe I won\'92t get married. Maybe * I\'92ll travel and take lovers and be * friends with Gail and Oprah. * BROOKS * Plenty of unmarried women have * fulfilling lives. They adopt * animals, volunteer. * MIRA You know what? This pizza sucks. * The food was better in jail. BROOKS Then why are you eating all of it? It\'92s to share. * MIRA This is not an individual pizza? God, pizzas are getting so small these days. BROOKS Well, if he\'92s not depressed, he\'92s probably a murderer, or in love * with his mom or something. Or both. * (then) * You know, you actually didn\'92t do a * terrible job with that breach. * MIRA I knew it, stalker! You were lurking like a vulture! * BROOKS Yeah, my master plan was that you\'92d * get distracted and make a rambling, offensive speech, and then, I\'92d * pounce. MIRA (amazed) That was kind of funny, Brooks. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 37. BROOKS * I supposed we\'92re both capable of * impressing each other, once a * decade or so. * They sit in not-unfriendly silence. * MIRA * You know what? This morning, I woke * up in jail because I was broken up * over a guy who fixes teeth for a * living. Now, I\'92m watching one of my * favorite movies, I have a new * patient, I just delivered a baby * into this world, and- * (extra proudly) * I barely ate anything today. This * is working. This is progress. * BROOKS Connect four. * MIRA You had to mess it up, didn\'92t you. Mira knocks over the game and leaves the room. Brooks looks off a her: what a weirdo. * INT. MIRA\'92S APARTMENT - LATE THAT SAME NIGHT * Mira\'92s in pajamas, talking on the phone in her living room. * GWEN (O.S.) * So you stood up your rich, not * bald, not-fat, not-depressed, not- * married blind date I set you up * with. * MIRA * I did not stand him up. I just had * to leave before dinner came. * We hear Mira\'92s buzzer. * GWEN (O.S.) * Who is that? It\'92s 2am. * MIRA * Delivery. * (then) * Besides, I\'92m not even sure he * really does do Beyonce\'92s finances. * Wouldn\'92t he have led with that? I * feel like maybe he was a murderer. * Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 38. GWEN (O.S.) * I\'92m never setting you up again. * MIRA * (with love) * Yes you are, Gwenny. Because I\'92m * changing, I can really feel it. * Tomorrow will be different. * The door opens. It\'92s Jeremy. He smiles and comes inside and * starts taking off his clothes. * MIRA (CONT\'92D) * (a little guilty) * And if not tomorrow, the day after. * I swear. * She hangs up the phone. She smiles. * END OF SHOW Untitled Mindy Kaling Show Pilot 1/9/12 39.}
